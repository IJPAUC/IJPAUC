<p><em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> first crossed Spielberg’s radar in January 1980, when he accepted an invitation to Warner Bros. to see if anything on their production slate appealed to him. Spielberg had always liked the <em>Twilight Zone</em> property, and decided to invite Landis—his friend, with whom he’d discussed doing a collaboration—to co-produce it with him. They settled on the concept of doing it as an anthology series, with each of them directing one of (then) three segments.</p>
<p>In March—by the time of contract negotiations—Spielberg and Landis initially proposed a “negative pickup” arrangement, by which the filmmaker simply had to deliver the finished “negative” in order to fulfill their contractual obligation and be paid. Then, to finance the movie the filmmaker(s) takes out a bank loan. (Landis discusses the freedom afforded by negative pickup arrangements in a 2023 <a href="https://youtu.be/pIZk6jN3g0s?si=7wz8-W7GHfE-_3Kj&amp;t=590">interview</a>.)</p>
<p>The studio insisted, however, on some basic oversights. This was a non-negotiable given Landis’s track record—<em>Blues Brothers, Animal House—</em>for what LaBrecque aptly calls “demolition derby realism” (3).</p>
<p>Although Spielberg seemed to be completely reformed since the debacle of his high-budget flop, <em>1941</em> (1979), if he was willing to ensure reining himself in, all the better.</p>
<p>The parties agreed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Landis, through Levitsky Productions, Inc., would receive $150,000 for his work on <em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> ($30,000 for writing; $30,000 for producing; $90,000 for directing).  </li>
<li>Co-producer split: 50-50 between Landis and Spielberg.  </li>
<li>They each received five gross points (5%) of the movie&#39;s earnings, escalating to 12.5% of gross receipts beyond $15 million, and 15% beyond the initial break-even. Even though <em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> had modest box office earnings with $34 million domestic, these gross points would amount to approximately $3.5 million for each of them, not counting international box office, rental, or licensing fees.  </li>
<li>Landis had the final cut on his segment, provided the film was completed on schedule and budget (no more than 10% over) and rated PG.  </li>
<li>“John acknowledges that Steven may have a presentation credit. The credits to John on screen and in paid advertising shall be not less equal in size and treatment than all other similar producer, writer and director credits other than the presentation credit to Steven.”  </li>
<li>Frank Marshall: $100,000 flat fee, 0.5% of gross after break-even, and 3% of net profit. Richard Matheson and George Miller: Small percentage of net profit apart from fees. (Chain 54-56)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Spielberg, Landis, and Marshall, were all literally invested in the box office performance of the film they were making in a variety of ways (i.e., as individuals, but also with regards to the profile of Amblin). As well, because of the autonomy afforded by the arrangement, the filmmakers themselves stood to recover any budget surplus. Regardless, it was the same, “time is money,” bootstrapper M.O. that Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy had implemented to such great success ever since the production of <em>Raiders</em> in 1980. (Consider the choice of helicopter pilot—the cheapest among the bidders, who had never flown before in Film or Television, only in combat—and that Allingham was presenting himself to prospective bidders as representing “Fly by Night Productions” for some reason.)</p>

<p>Uncontroversially, “Fly by Night” was painted onto the nose of the crashed helicopter, and wiped off by midday. In light of the accident, the idiom was </p>
<p>According to Chain, “Fly by Night Productions” had been the proposed name for Landis’s wing of the Spielberg-Landis co-production during the <em>first</em> round of contract negotiations with Warner Bros, when it would have been necessary for Landis’s segment to be represented by an entity of its own, rather than one for the whole production (Twilight Zone Productions).</p>
<p>According to LaBrecque (26), at least, there was an economic incentive as well.</p>
<p>“Fly by Night [Productions]” was “a joking tribute to Steven Spielberg, who had called his own production company by that nickname” [to suggest to bidders that they were a rough-and-scrappy independent, rather than funded by the majors? In fact, Landis’s own Producers did the same thing, presenting themselves to helicopter rental companies, at least Clay Wright, as “Fly by Night Productions” (See Chain Ch. 31).</p>

<p><strong>The crew were being paid by “Twilight Zone Productions, Inc.” and their pay stubs were stamped “Disc Management Services Group.”</strong></p>
<p>According to Ed Morey, the Warner Brothers VP assigned to the project, Twilight Zone Productions had its own payroll system, independent of Warner Brothers, named “DISC Management Systems, Inc.” (Grand Jury, June 1st, 1983). The production coordinator (Donna Schuman) testified that: “George Folsey instructed Disc Management to issue a check for petty cash” (Grand Jury May 31st, 1983). Not much is known about Disc Management Systems, Inc. Its name (as far as this author knows) appears in the credits of only a single released feature film—Amblin’s <em>Arachnophobia</em> (1990)—and has its corporate address at the fringe of the Warner Brothers lot.</p>

<p>The corporate address of DISC Management is significant because the cheque instrumental in the hiring of the children came from a Twilight Zone Productions, Inc. on a Warner Bros cheque.</p>
<p>Landis’ offices at the time were on the Universal Studios lot, where he had a production deal, about 10 minutes away by car.</p>

<p><strong>#Chain</strong></p>
<p>New research (2022). Journalist who attended the trial Steve Chain claims access to several inter-departmental Warner Brothers memos documenting interviews conducted by their legal team with various Warner Brothers employees, including Marshall, Fisher, Vane, Radford, Henderling, Morey, and Cohn.</p>
<p>Although this is an audacious claim, and Chain’s book has no notes, references, or sources, there are several reasons to find it plausible. (1) Chain attended the trial at the time and is a reporter in good-standing, recommended by other reporters that covered the trial, e.g., the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner’s Andy Furillo; (2) the book is endorsed by Harland Braun, Landis’ pre-trial lawyer; (3) if Cohn was questioned by Warner Bros.&#39; legal counsel without independent representation, and records of this questioning existed, his later counsel could and would have subpoenaed copies of those records, bringing them within the ambit of the defense’s varied coalition of attorneys; (4) all findings in the book are consistent with established evidence.</p>
<p>#Chen family</p>

<p>The Chen family included Mark Chen (an accountant), Shin Yen Chen, and their only daughter, Renee Chen (then 6-years-old). Mao Chang Chen (Grandmother, who answered the phone and relayed messages), Dr. Peter Chen (L.A. county department of mental health).</p>
<p>They lived in Pasadena.</p>

<p>They lived in Cerritos.</p>
<p>#Hua family</p>
<p>They lived in Echo Park. Elysian Heights Elementary School; referred by principal to Ms. Julie Hua, an educational assistant who lived across the street, next to her sister. They and seven children were also brought to the Twilight Zone set at Franklin Canyon Reservoir, where Landis selected two of Hua’s sister’s children for the roles, but ended up giving them to Myca and Renee instead. Ms. Hua said that Folsey called her to apologize, but offered her $600 for her own children to stay on standby during the shoot. He paid her the $600 on the evening of Wednesday July 21st, before the white van continued on to the Chen house.</p>
<p>Ms. Hua ended up testifying in Folsey and the filmmakers’ defense, happy to be included in the production of the film, and having enjoyed her rapport with the producer.</p>
<p>he’d volunteered his own children for the roles</p>
<p>Harland Braun was stopped by Jim Sanders from asking a question whose answer Braun thought would be the most compelling vindication of Folsey. Braun wanted Landis to confirm that Folsey had recommended substituting his own two children instead of illegally hiring two Vietnamese children. If Folsey was willing to use his own children, he could not possibly have thought the scene was dangerous, Braun reasoned.</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t ask him that question right now,&quot; Jim Sanders asked of Braun, explaining that he knew Landis would smile at hearing it. Braun held off and at lunch asked Landis if he remembered that Folsey had made such an offer. Landis smiled at the question, just as Sanders had predicted, and Braun became enraged at the director.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think is so <strong>funny</strong> about that?&quot; Braun asked Landis. &quot;These two kids get killed and George Folsey was suggesting his own kids?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, it was so silly, the idea of using two larger Caucasians that I think is ridiculous,&quot; Landis replied.</p>
<p>Incredulous, Braun continued, &quot;Don&#39;t you understand the moral distinction between you as a director thinking it was cinematically silly and George Folsey as a father instinctively using his own children?&quot; When Braun finally asked Landis the question in front of the jury, the director answered without a smile. (LaBrecque 227)</p>
<p>Folsey especially seemed unable to confront the reality of what he had done.</p>
<p><strong>“And I grabbed the two parents of the two children who were standing with me and turned and pulled them and ran and dove into some bushes that were about 25 feet away from where we had been standing. And then we came back the helicopter was down. And I noticed that the I didn’t realize this until I testified before the NTSB that the that rotor blade that I think is part of the tail tarot of the helicopter ended up exactly where the parents and I were standing to observe.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Cast himself as the hero]</strong></p>
<p>“In early August, Donna Schuman met for lunch with George Folsey, Jr. at Hampton&#39;s restaurant in Toluca Lake. She was not pleased with the answers she received to her questions about the fatal night. In time, the deteriorating friendship between the two would play an important role in the prosecution of the <em>Twilight Zone</em> case.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to know why three people are dead,&quot; she said challengingly.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Folsey said.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t understand how you can have that kind of an accident.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s just the same as if you have two cars running down the street, and they get in an accident.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s not the same at all. That analogy just doesn&#39;t work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We rehearsed it at least thirty times,&quot; Folsey said—quite inaccurately.<br>&quot;Everybody knew exactly what they were doing. There was no question about what was going on. At the time of the accident, the helicopter was far away from the children. No one could have predicted it. It was an act of God. No one ever knew.&quot;</p>
<p>Folsey was obviously wrong in his assessment because not everyone at Indian Dunes had been in accord before the helicopter was damaged by the fireballs. As I would observe in my later conversations with Folsey, he was a man of gentle spirit who had been greatly disturbed by the deaths—in conversations with his priest in the days following the deaths, he had discussed the morality of his involvement in the matter—but also resisted suggestions that the crash was anything but an innocent happenstance.” (LaBrecque 67)</p>

He expressed reservations: “he was concerned for safety in the water for the children, since it did involve some shallow water, and he was concerned that the children were being used at all in a scene that had some loud noises, big lights, flames, special effects.<br>…<br>She escorted children to motor home on Wednesday night.”</p>

<p>He said that after the crash, he left the location, driving the pickup truck, following Carl, who was driving the 10-ton powder truck. He said that Carl was weaving badly all the way back to the Burbank Studios. He said he was alone in the pickup truck and that Carl was alone in the 10-ton truck.</p>
<p>He concluded that, while on the set, he recalled asking ANDY HOUSE what kids were doing on the night set. He said Mr. House told him to mind his own business.</p>
<p><strong>#Epstein</strong></p>
<p>Folsey brought the production’s young PA, Carolyn Lee-Epstein, into the fold in early July, when she was asked by Folsey to drive over to a mechanic&#39;s garage in the San Fernando Valley so that Mr. Folsey could pick up his vintage Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>During this drive, Mr. Folsey asked Carolyn if she knew any [Asian] children that &quot;we&quot; can use. Miss Epstein stated that although Mr. Folsey did not refer to the final scene of the movie, she knew that this was what he was referring to. She had read the script. She stated that she didn&#39;t understand why Mr. Folsey was asking her if she knew any [Asian] children, however, possibly because she was [Asian] and maybe had family or friends with [Asian] children. She stated that it didn&#39;t seem too out of the ordinary at the time. She told Mr. Folsey that she didn&#39;t know anyone who had [Asian] children, and that Mr. Folsey responded in a nonchalant manner, &quot;Well, we have to be careful about this.&quot; (Budds, Interview, September 21st, 1983)</p>

<p>3. “A Steven Spielberg Production” (or, at the very least, “Steven Spielberg Presents”<strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> (1983) was most likely originally going to be “a Steven Spielberg production.” This is only significant as part of a broader circumstantial argument that Spielberg had every likelihood of being deeply invested in the film’s production. </p>
<ol>
<li>Initial news reports said so, and so did the first NTSB report.</li>
</ol>
<p>“The film, “Twilight Zone” is a STEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCTION funded by Warner Bros. Inc,., Burbank California (2)”--NTSB Report</p>
<p>![][image13]<br><em>Twilight Zone: The Movie appears on Amblin’s website.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The Deal Memo Reserved a “Presentation Credit” for Spielberg</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Poltergeist</em> (1982) had been “A Steven Spielberg Production”; <em>E.T.</em> (1982) had been “A Steven Spielberg Film”; and <em>Goonies</em> (1984) would be “Steven Spielberg Presents.” Most likely, <em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> was originally going to be a “Steven Spielberg Production.”</p>
<p>Spielberg was about to try to do with Landis what Phillips had tried to get him to do with <em>Close Encounters</em> about five years earlier, and turn a single film into a “cottage industry.”</p>
<p>“Ted Ashley, who was Serling&#39;s agent at the time that the writer created <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, had graduated to the position of chairman of the board at Warner Bros. Following the success of <em>Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind,</em> and <em>Alien</em> in the late seventies, Ashley decided the time was right to create a big-screen fantasy built around the concept of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. <em>Star Trek</em>, another TV show that had a fanatical cult following, was being turned into a whole series of feature films. Ashley imagined the same future for <em>Twilight Zone</em>.” (F\&amp;G 64)</p>
<p>“Nobody ever felt the same about the movie. Before the accident, everyone was talking about sequels, and that idea was forgotten.” –Carol Serling (qtd. in F\&amp;G 172)</p>
<p><em>[Is it possible the movie was originally going to be subtitled “Fly by Night”?]</em></p>
<p>Although Twilight Zone: The Movie likely did alter the future of the Amblin product line, otherwise and since, a “Steven Spielberg Production,” conveys a very specific vibe.</p>
