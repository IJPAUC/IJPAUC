<p>1. 3rd Draft (Cont’d)</p>
<p>Suddenly LOUD NOISE and WIND as a HUEY HELICOPTER appears from over the cliff and hovers over the village.</p>
<p>Bill stands as both kids cling to him in terror.</p>
<p>BILL (Cont’d)<br>(shouts)<br>Help us! I’ve got children down here!</p>
<ol>
<li>HELICOPTER’S P.O.V. - NIGHT</li>
</ol>
<p>Bill waving his arms</p>
<ol>
<li>EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT</li>
</ol>
<p>The machine gun mounted in the copter opens fire on Bill. He grabs the kids and runs for cover.</p>
<p>BILL<br>(screaming)<br>Stop it! I’ve got children here!<br>Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p>Bill clutching the kids crouches behind one of the huts. The helicopter turns on a powerful spotlight and hovers over the village sweeping it with its beam.</p>
<p>BILL (Cont’d)<br>(To kids)<br>I’ll keep you safe kids. I promise. Nothing will hurt you. I swear to God.</p>
<p>The helicopter makes another pass over the village and then one of the huts EXPLODES in a spectacular fireball. One after another the buildings blow up in flames as the helicopter systematically destroys the village in its search for Bill.</p>
<p>Finally Bill, holding a child in each arm, makes a herculean effort and runs for the shallow river.</p>
<p>With the village burning behind them Bill runs as best he can across the river.</p>
<p><strong>2. Morey advised him</strong></p>
<p>Edward Morey, the Warner Bros Vice President in charge of the production of <em>Twilight Zone</em> is one of the case’s ambivalent figures.</p>
<p>On August 6th, 1982, Morey produced a letter which became a key part of the official story, constituting one tranche of the firewall protecting Warner Brothers and Amblin from the Landis group, (i.e., the people operating in Landis’s set of bungalows on the Universal Studios lot). (The second tranche being Dick Vane’s testimony that Executive Producer Marshall believed Landis to be using dummies for the 2:20am shot.)</p>
<p>In short, the letter said that he (Morey) had been out of town between July 2nd and 19th and when he got back made numerous attempts to figure out what was going on with the production viz. the children in the production schedule, but was misdirected and stalled by Unit Production Manager Dan Allingham.</p>
<p>But Morey neglected to mention or explain the July 20th calls from Frank Henderling in which Marshall informed Morey that Bonne Radford was asking on behalf of the Landis group how to go about paying children outside of the auspices of the Screen Extras Guild, “under the table” (to use Henderling’s words), and that he suspected the $2,000 “personal cash advance” subsequently requested by Radford was going to be used toward that end. He didn’t want to sign it.</p>
<p>But Henderling advised him to sign it, saying that they had no reason to deny a producer a cash advance. Henderling signed it grudgingly.</p>
<p>Chain reports that Henderling had already brought up Radford’s initial alarming request to Morey, and Morey had been against going outside the Extras Guild. According to Chain, it was only after Radford consulted with Marshall that the check was crafted (Ch. 25). Was Morey’s advice to Henderling a principled oversight, or because he’d received a call from Frank Marshall?</p>
<p><strong>3. “Like staring into the sun.” [Under Construction]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Testimonials from 11:30pm “near-miss.”</strong></p>
<p>Although the nearness of disaster wasn’t immediately apparent to the spectators, the rest of the crew attested to being terrified. Roger Smith, the cameraman, said the heat was “just like somebody opened the oven door.” The stuntman/stunt coordinator, Gary McLarty, who’d leapt into the helicopter to avoid being burned, told the NTSB that he told Landis, “we can’t take anything hotter or bigger.” The pilot, Dorcey Wingo, a Vietnam combat veteran, yelled out, “Chickenshit! Chickenshit!”; “This is bullshit!”; “This is a bunch of bullshit!”; “This is too much!”; “They didn’t tell me about that!” They furiously insisting to Allingham, the Unit Production Manager (think: office manager)—who was operating the heavy ‘Nite-Sun’ spotlight they had rented out the pilot’s side window to track Vic and the kids—that he tell Landis that something needed to be changed to make the shot safer. But when they landed, Landis was across the water, at the village, and they couldn’t get to him, and the rest of the crew had already started their “lunch” at the nearby canteen area. </p>
<p><strong>“Never have I been anywhere near any intensity like that, ever, period, in my life.” (Randall Robinson, Camera D asst., Grand Jury)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. At least 14 gasoline-powered pyrotechnic charges [Under Construction]</strong></p>
<p>Three special effects men, each in charge of a series.</p>
<p>Key controversy: who fired the fatal blast, and why (i.e., why then? What was their cue so to speak?).</p>
<p>Were they fired by SFX man James Camomile or Jerry Williams?</p>
<p>Although the defense eventually blamed Jimmy Camomile for the fatal blast, forensic and sound evidence indicate that an earlier explosion—specifically the one beneath the <strong>No. 4 open-air fish-drying hut</strong>—occurred first and was the actual initiating event. That blast blew through the floor of the open-air fishing hut and expelled debris which struck and fractured the tail rotor blade, causing catastrophic rotor failure.</p>
<p>Who <em>placed</em> the fatal bomb, where, and why?</p>
<p>And who <em>triggered</em> it, based on what cue?</p>
<p>In one of the pictures used as an Exhibit in the trial, Jerry Williams was photographed (by the Chapman Crane truck driver) standing beside John Landis; Mike Milgrom (the propman, a friend of Landis’s; firing a marble gun), and Camera C (Connor).</p>
<p>This created a manifestly unsafe situation for the obvious reason that different commands could easily be confused for different cues in this situation by the gunners (marble), or the gunners (stuntmen), the actors, or the special effects crew.</p>
<p>“Lower! Lower! Lower!”</p>
<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!” </p>
<p>And, certainly, someone had replaced the live ammunition in the guns.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Additional explosives; shock-wave inducing explosives—100 grain prima cord?! (See Chain Ch. 29)</p>
<p>5. The Stumble</p>
<p>During the fatal 2:20am shot, after traversing just past the 50-foot mark in the water (marked by the “eukie stick”), Morrow stumbled to his knees, and momentarily forced Renee face-first into the black water. </p>
<p>Excerpt from Landis cross-examination, qtd. In LaBrecque:</p>
<p>“It was planned that Vic should stumble,” Landis testified. </p>
<p>I think you are having a problem with the fact that what makes this so especially terrible, which is that they are acting, that Vic is acting, and it looks horrendous. Because it’s supposed to look horrendous. And the tragedy makes it that much harder to watch.</p>
<p>The prosecutor asked Landis if it was also planned that Morrow would almost drop Renee in the water.</p>
<p>“We did not discuss dropping Renee, and I don’t believe he did.”</p>
<p>He said it was first decided during the 2:00 a.m. rehearsal that Morrow would stumble, but also conceded that Morrow did not practice carrying either the children or other weights through the water first. (LaBrecque 233)</p>
<p>Excerpt from Landis cross-examination (notes by court stenographer)</p>
<p>Landis: [Discussing cues] Hovering over the sampan. Waving megaphone cue to Vic. Vic cross in straight line. Then ‘safe distance’ cue for machine gun fire, which was cue for sfx people. 3 explosions would go off 1, 2, 3. Then Dorsey would turn and make his way across the river. For instance the rehearsal to set up the lighting and stuff, Bobby Liddle walked back and forth with Allen Goldenhar, with a light meter, and you wouldn’t ask you star to do that.”</p>
<p>DA: And this is the point in time in which you supposedly told Vic Morrow — or you discussed him falling down, right, or tripping, or stumbling?</p>
<p>Landis: Soon after that, yes.</p>
<p>DA: Well did you ever tell the grand jury that it was planned for Viv Morrow to stumble or to Fall?</p>
<p>Landis: No.</p>
<p>DA: Did you tell the NTSB that it was planned for Morrow to stumble or to fall?</p>
<p>Landis: I didn’t, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>DA: Did you tell the Camera Operators to be sure and watch for that, because that was going to occur?</p>
<p>Landis: Yes, I wouldn’t know which camera now. As we saw the footage, he was in a specific spot that we had discussed for that camera, and I am sorry, I don’t…—</p>
<p>DA: The Master camera, Mr. Lydecker?</p>
<p>L: No, certainly not the master. Whichever one would have been tightest on Vic and the Children <strong>[i.e., Camera A, Arnold Rich; who testifies to the opposite.]</strong></p>
<p>2nd AD Andy House and Morrow’s stand-in, Robert Liddle, both testified to witnessing an alarming incident before and after the 9:30pm special effects shot, when during a run-through and the actual shot, Morrow both times accidentally dropped a child into the water (first Myca, then Renee). House alerted Cohn to the possibility of drowning; Cohn told Landis; Landis asked the children; “one could swim, one could not.”</p>
<p>If Morrow’s fatal stumble was rehearsed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is it possible that Renee could swim, so she was the one that would be dropped as part of the stumble?</p>
</li>
<li><p>But more significantly: if the stumble was rehearsed, and if the helicopter’s position was yoked to Vic Morrow’s position (tracking him at point X for Cameras C and F’s carefully framed profile shot, light-measured for during the documented 2:00am rehearsal footage).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And even if the stumble wasn’t rehearsed (<em>against</em> Landis’s own testimony): the children had fallen into the water twice before and one of them told you they couldn’t swim and you just kept going with the next big, bigger take?</p>

<p>7. Landis Denied</p>
<p>8. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-18-ca-714-story.html">LA Times Article</a></p>
<p>In July 1990, Marshall finally broke his silence and set the record straight.</p>
<p>He denied that he’d been evading subpoenas, and said he’d simply been busy through the pre-trial investigations, and then overseas. “So, I was inaccessible. And I didn’t really feel that I had anything to add that wasn’t already out there, than what had already been revealed.” </p>
<p>D.A. Garcetti however made clear that his office made “every effort possible to subpoena Frank Marshall but he was able to get out of our hands.”</p>
<p>Marshall was promoting a new film, his directorial debut, Amblin’s <em>Arachnaphobia</em> (1990).</p>
<p>9.  <a href="#bookmark=kix.i2j2et1d0xbc"><strong>Questions to Ask</strong></a></p>
<p>Part 1. a semantic misunderstanding?</p>
<p><strong>Marshall (if Chain’s claims are true),</strong></p>
<p> <strong>seems to leave room for the possibility that on the Friday, July 9th meeting, in Folsey’s Office on the Universal Studios Lot, when he and Landis, Folsey, and Allingham were trying to resolve the practical issue caused by the addition of the two young children to the script, namely in its newly added Vietnamese action-rescue sequence, that Marshall mistakenly believed Allingham told him “no problem” in response to being told to “forget it” (with regards to receiving a waiver to work children of that age legally).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The basic problem is this:</strong> </p>
<p>Somehow Marshall, despite being warned about Landis’s intentions by a casting agent, which Landis confirmed, failed to prevent the hiring and endangerment plan from coming to pass, even though Marshall was on-set both nights, including at 2:30am-5:00am (according to Landis) while the production was wrapping up the interior hut scene with the two little children, and according to Landis <strong>consulted</strong> on the decision to roll-over the massive 6-camera, helicopter and explosives rescue sequence (3 setups) they still needed to shoot until the following night. </p>
<p>(Folsey told the parents they would be done as quickly as possible, “<strong>first thing</strong>,” and would receive $500—the same rate, no matter if they were finished early. It was the first time the exhausted parents heard about the possibility of another day, and they scrambled to accommodate the producer, who had positioned himself as a friend despite his private reservations. The parents arranged for a single parent to return the next day. Folsey even assured them they would not be needed at all, and the could take care of their children on their behalf. He reminded them that if a Fire Safety Officer asked them if they were working, they were to tell him they were just helping out a friend, and not to mention the envelopes of cash they’d just been given off the books for their participation in the Hollywood production.)</p>
<p>But where did that cash come from? Uncontroversially, $2,000 came from a Personal Cash Advance cheque requested by Folsey on July 20th, co-signed by Frank Marshall, and shortly cashed (Chain says by Landis’ mother, Shirley Levine, who worked at the Mitsui Manufacturers Bank in Beverly Hills, and whose initials appear on the back of the cheque).</p>
<p>In any case, following that trail reveals that Frank Henderling, a 75-year-old Warner Brothers payroll watchdog—the other signer—was reluctant to sign the cheque because he believed it was going to be used to hire children illegally, The reason he believed this is because just hours earlier, he had been called by Bonne Radford (Amblin’s longtime accountant, assigned to Twilight Zone, and Marshall’s payroll management company, DISC Management Systems, which had been contracted by Warner Brothers to fulfill insurance obligations, especially in light of Landis’s reputation for recklessness), on behalf of Twilight Zone Productions—the production entity connecting Warner Brothers, Levitsky Productions, and Amblin Productions, Inc.—asking about the possibility of hiring extras without going through the Screen Extras Guild. This was on July 20th, three days before the accident.</p>
<p>Marshall has never spoken about the incident except once, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-18-ca-714-story.html">to the LA Times in 1990</a>, unconvincingly, to distance himself from it, but presumably he would maintain he had no idea the true purpose of Folsey’s advance.</p>
<p>(Indeed, this is what <strong>Chain</strong> claims Marshall told Warner Bros’ in-house legal team in the immediate days after the accident, testimony which survives in internal memos possibly leaked as a consequence of the massive, tangled alliance of lawyers working on behalf of the various defendants. But more on the scope and significance of these memos momentarily, should they be authentic.)</p>
<p>The $2,000 received by Folsey would have been needed to pay the Hua family $600 to stay on standby (LaBrecque 26), and $500 for each of the families.</p>
<p>But this only accounts for $1600. Folsey would’ve needed at least $2600 by the time he needed to pay out the parents on the second night, presuming the filming had gone off without a hitch.</p>
<p>This lines up with the testimony of an office Production Assistant named Carolyn Lee-Epstein.</p>
<p>“Miss Epstein continued that, either the day prior to, or the day of the final scene, she was told by either Dan Allingham or George Folsey to go over to the Burbank Studios, and contact Bonnie Radford to pick up petty cash which was going to be paid to the Oriental children for their participation in the final scene. Miss Epstein stated that over a period of a couple days there were several conversations between Folsey, Allingham, and possibly John Landis about oriental children and payment of $1,000. She said that she remembers the amount because she was surprised and had remarked to others in the office that the children seemed to be getting paid an awful lot of money. She stated that there was one particular conversation in the office that Folsey was having with possibly Landis and Allingham discussing the amount of payment to the two oriental children for the final scene and she believe that this conversation took place just prior to her being told to pick up the thousand from petty cash vis-a-vis Bonnie Radford. She stated that George Folsey approached her in the office and told her to pick up the petty cash at which time she recalled being told that NO W-2 FORMS WOULD BE FILLED OUT FOR THE CHILDREN. Miss Epstein stated that she drove to the Burbank Studios and contacted Bonnie Radford who appeared to be expecting her. She said she picked up petty cash and believed that she had signed for it. She stated that the money was inside a sealed brown envelope. She then returned to the production office and handed the brown envelope to George Folsey.</p>
<p>Miss Epstein stated that after the crash, she was asked by John Landis to stay on as his assistant and that she continued to work for him until the end of October 1982 at which time Mr. Landis went to New York City to film the movie “Trading Places.” (Lee-Epstein testified to similar effect at the trial.)</p>
<p>In other words, the day of the crash (July 22nd/23rd) or the day before (July 21st), a messenger travelled from Landis’s offices on the Universal Studios lot, making the 5-minute drive to the Warner Brothers Studio (The Burbank Lot), where she met with Bonne Radford “who seemed to be expecting her,” and who produced for her a brown envelope filled with $1,000 in cash. (Giving Folsey a total of $3,000 to work with, i.e., enough to cover the $2600 he’d already paid or promised out and then some mad money just in case one of the little rascals got cold feet.)</p>
<p>This makes at least two instances when Radford facilitated the procurement of cash for what she knew to be an “under the table” hiring (as Henderling put it; if his testimony is to be believed).</p>
<p>The co-signing of the cheque could have taken place over the phone; but if Epstein’s testimony is to be believed, she was handed an envelope full of cash by Bonne Radford, who (based on Henderling’s testimony) knew its purpose, from somewhere on the Warner Brothers lot (Amblin, according to LaBrecque), the day before the night of the accident in which two illegally hired children were killed.</p>
<p>On whose authority was Ms. Radford acting? And had she deliver the cash to her own office at Warner Brothers, or the one associated with Marshall’s payroll management company, or the offices of Amblin Entertainment?</p>
<p>The evidence is overwhelming that Marshall knew that children were being hired illegally (and therefore would need to be <em>paid</em>). He was a regular presence on-set (at least 8 of 12 days, including the 2 days the children were working). </p>
<p>How could he not have not known, especially if he had seen with his own eyes the two young children working in the early hours of July 22nd, and next to explosives at 9:30pm later that evening?</p>
<p>Although Marshall never cooperated with authorities, one of his close associates, Richard Vane, testified at the Grand Jury that during the fatal shot, both he and Marshall believed dolls were being used.</p>
<p>The court reporters summary of Vane’s testimony:</p>
<p>DA: Know children being used?</p>
<p>RV: No, I thought we were going to use dolls. Or I didn&#39;t really think. My job is not to be involved in that sort of stuff. But I just assumed we were going to have dolls, because that would be the ordinary way that that sort of thing would be done.</p>
<p>Standing next to camera crane</p>
<p>Frank Marshall was standing next to him for 2:20 shot.<br>&quot;It was pretty dark. We could make out Vic Morrow and John Landis. It was just outlines as far as Morrow was concerned. Landis we could see pretty well.</p>
<p>He had a megaphone.</p>
<p>When he saw Morrow pick up kids, he thought it was dolls. And John and Vic had some conversation, and he picked up what turned out to be the kids right after that.&quot;</p>
<p>Turned to Frank Marshall - can&#39;t quote conversation exactly:</p>
<p><strong>But the substance of it was that we just assumed he was picking up—unconsciously—all this happened very rapidly—we were just assuming that they were dolls.</strong></p>
<p>Vane at that time was the highest-ranking member of the production to admit to participating in an on-set conspiracy to conceal the presence of the children from an FSO known to be trained as an on-set teacher and children’s welfare advocate. How could Vane not know real children were about to be used? </p>
<p>DA: how they would be there in violation of the law?<br>RV: yes, i knew that they were going to be there. I did not think that they would be in the explosion scene. There was a scene that was going to follow that in which the kids were in a shelter.</p>
<p>Vane claims he believed they were being saved for some pick-up shots to come after this one.</p>
<p>Why did he assume Landis was using dolls in the last shot, when he very well knew Landis was using real children near explosives just hours earlier, and deep into the early morning the night before?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Now, if you accept Chain’s claim of internal Warner Brothers memos (which I believe are authentic, but we can assume they’re not) documenting their in-house counsel’s interviews with Marshall, Fisher, Vane, Cohn, Henderling, and others.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lucy Fisher, who told Warner Bros, that:</li>
</ol>
<p>“Landis’ script revisions were approved by the studio, but Lucy Fisher, apparently, had one more reservation: she specifically asked Frank Marshall and John Landis whether using the children at night would be a “problem.” According to a memo generated by Warner’s own internal investigation of the crash, both men told her not to worry about it.” (Chain Ch. 18)</p>
<ol>
<li>Marshall’s own account:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[[In short, Marshall’s story.]]</strong><br><strong>– Second meeting. Production could get waivers until later on if older children used?</strong><br><strong>– Sticking point: final shot specifically. Marshall expected dummies would be used for this shot and not children, younger or older.</strong><br><strong>– Marshall, “Forget it,” [with regards to using children legally.]</strong><br><strong>– Allingham, “No problem, we’ll be far away.”</strong><br><strong>– Marshall HEARD: “We won’t need to use real children.”</strong><br><strong>– Allingham, MEANT “The children can be staged further from the danger than will appear through long lenses, not accounting for the danger nevertheless evident.]]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proxy for another: He knew the children were being used <em>illegally</em> (no waivers), but not for the 2:20 shot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helps us understand what Marshall’s argument might be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proxy. He knew about the illegal hiring (9:30pm), but thought the kids were older, and that they’d use dummies for the 2:20am shot.</strong><br><strong>But why did he give Landis a pass for the 9:30pm shot, just to get</strong><br><strong>kids in the sequence? Exceptionally poor professional judgement?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aristotle metaphor of the eclipse for syllogizing, like trying to see a moon behind a moon by way of deduction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Locating Spielberg’s influence if any.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Need to motivate Radford’s behavior, need to motivate Marshall’s. Spielberg wanted it done for x y z?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2nd part is more like reconstructing a vase from range of shards to minute shards.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Spielberg’s creative finger prints?</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the various clues and considerations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3rd part is JP pre-production in light of Spielberg’s Freudian commitments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Freud, black box, case by case basis, statement about emphasis, but; can’t be automated:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Thus the work of analysis involves an art of interpretation the successful handling of which may require tact and practice but which is not hard to acquire. But it is not only in the saving of labour that the method of free association has an advantage over the earlier method. It exposes the patient to the least possible amount of compulsion, it never allows of contact being lost with the actual current situation, it guarantees to a great extent that no factor in the structure of the neurosis will be overlooked and that nothing will be introduced into it by the expectations of the analyst. It is left to the patient in all essentials to determine the course of the analysis and the arrangement of the material; any systematic handling of particular symptoms or complexes thus becomes impossible. In complete contrast to what happened with hypnotism and with the urging method, interrelated material makes its appearance at different times and at different points in the treatment. To a spectator, therefore — though in fact there can be, none — an analytic treatment would seem completely obscure.”</strong></p>
<p>Questions to Ask (5 People Who Were Never Asked Questions)</p>
<p>Lucy Fisher: </p>
<p>Did Frank Marshall know about the unlawful hiring? Steve Chain states that she told Warner Bros. that Landis and Marshall assured her the children would not be a problem (Chain, Ch. 18). Chain also claims she said she did not want to know and would deny involvement if questioned. Is this accurate? </p>
<p>Did Spielberg provide any story notes that you know of on any drafts or revisions of the “Twilight Zone—Landis Episode,” whether in a professional or personal capacity?</p>
<p>Bonne Radford: </p>
<p>On July 20, 1982, when you contacted Frank Henderling, were you acting under Frank Marshall’s authority to obtain $2,000, knowing it was intended for hiring minors outside the Screen Extras Guild? On July 22, 1982, was the $1,000 in cash you disbursed handed-off from a location on the Warner Bros lot? Namely, Amblin Entertainment, Inc., at its original Warner Bros location (LaBrecque 22)?</p>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy: </p>
<p>Did you contact the labor board between July 5-9, 1982, to ask about waivers for hiring young children? </p>
<p>Were you told they could only work until “8:00 or 8:30 p.m.”, or were Landis and his co-defendants mistaken or untruthful in claiming you did? </p>
<p>On July 22, 1982, at 9:30 p.m., did you witness the conditions on set, including children in close proximity to live explosives, a helicopter flying overhead, and a water hazard? If so, why did you not intervene?</p>
<p>Frank Marshall: </p>
<p>Why, despite being warned about Landis’s intentions to hire two children illegally over a month in advance by a trusted casting agent, did you fail to stop the hiring from coming to pass, and fatally so?</p>
<p>If you were unaware of the purpose of the $2,000 cheque you signed, how do you explain the sworn statements of Landis, Folsey, and Allingham that you gave them your explicit approval to solicit children outside the auspices of the screen extras guild, even volunteering to assist in the process?</p>
<p>Why did your accountant, Bonne Radford, facilitate cash disbursements for Landis’s production on the Warner Bros. lot, as corroborated by Frank Henderling and Carolyn Lee-Epstein? </p>
<p>Does your explanation match that of the alleged executive memo transcribing your testimony to Warner Bros lawyers (see Chain Ch. 47), in which you are alleged to explain that you thought they were going to use older children with waivers for the 9:30 shot, but believed you had reached an understanding with them that for the final shot, dummies would be used, because Allingham told you that the issue of the children would be “no problem” for the final shot? Still, if so, why didn’t you check, given Landis’s track record?</p>
<p>On July 21-23, 1982, did you witness the labor conditions of the young immigrant children, including their exposure to live explosives on July 22 at 9:30 p.m.? If so, why did you not intervene?</p>
<p>Did you really have Kathleen Kennedy call the labor board, or were you just speculating on the 8:00-8:30pm waiver cutoff (which the labor board said they would have never given, defaulting to a flat 10:00pm extension), before telling Landis, Folsey, and Allingham to “forget it,” with regards to hiring young children to work past dark outside legally.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Spielberg:</strong> </p>
<p>Did you provide any notes or sketches regarding the creative development of Landis’s third or fourth drafts? Namely, story suggestions to Lucy Fisher, a few notes on the fourth draft, and several “thumbnail sketches”?</p>
<p>Why did you continue to work with Marshall, Vane, and Radford, to the extent that you knew about their participation in the child endangerment scandal?</p>
<p>I mean specifically, did you not know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dick Vane (Amblin Locations Manager, and Producer) admitted before a Grand Jury to participating in an on-set plot to conceal the presence of the illegally hired children from a safety officer?</p>
</li>
<li><p>A 75-year-old Warner Brothers payroll executive named Frank Henderling testified that Bonne Radford called him asking about how to hire two children illegally?</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Universal Studios P.A. named Carolyn Lee-Epstein testified that Radford personally supplied her with an envelope full of cash from an address on the Warner Brothers lot known (based on Henderling’s testimony) to be going towards the illegal employment of children for what the NTSB determined to be “<strong>stunts</strong>.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you know there were multiple subpoenas for Marshall’s testimony in the criminal trial, across half a decade?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you know that Marshall was warned about Landis’s intentions over a month in advance by a casting agent; that Landis says Marshall explicitly OK-d the hiring; that Marshall saw what was going on at 9:30pm that night and showed no sign of alarm, let alone bothered to check to ensure that children weren’t being used for the final shot (if he didn’t know.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you know that real children were going to be used in the production of the Vietnam rescue sequence in <em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em> (1983)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If so, why did you do nothing to stop it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
