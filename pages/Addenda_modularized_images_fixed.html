<div class="container"><section id="item1"><p>1. “8:00 or 8:30pm”</p>
<p>In Landis’s testimony (Feb 1987), he reported that on approx. Friday, July 9th, 1982, a second meeting between Marshall, himself, Folsey, and Allingham took place at Landis’s offices on the Universal Studios lot. He said that the first meeting—approx. Tuesday, July 6th, 1982—had hinged on Marshall’s question as to whether it would be possible to get waivers for the young children to work past 6:30pm, which Marshall knew to be the rule. The defendants say Marshall said he would have his colleague, Kathleen Kennedy, call the Labor Board to find out.</p>
<p>During the second meeting, the defendants say Marshall informed them that waivers could only be gotten until “8:00 or 8:30pm.” James Neal introduced this distinction for the first time during his opening statements for the criminal trial in September 1986.</p>
<p>According to Chain, Marshall told them to “forget about” the prospect of getting waivers for children younger than 8-years-old to film at night.</p>
<p>The defendants proceeded with the illegal hiring, under the impression that Marshall had endorsed their plan, and Marshall has never either confirmed or denied their account.</p>
<p>But if the defendants’ account of the “8:00 or 8:30pm” detail is correct, the question is raised of where Marshall came up with that number.</p>
<p>Colleen Logan, the Area Administrator for the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, testified that, upon request, the Department generally grants an extension until exactly 10:00pm (Cross Feb 87; Closing Arguments, May 87).</p>
<p>The significance of this discrepancy—as regards the factors influencing the 2:20am shot—is that it raises the question of <em>why Marshall would report the incorrect (earlier) timeframe to the defendants</em>?</p>
<p>Marshall and/or his liaison could’ve simply received or remembered the wrong information.</p>
<p>But is it possible that Marshall—with his manifest experience on producing sci-fi adventure films with children—already knew that waivers were unlikely to be granted <em>not only because of the timeframe</em> but <em>because of their proximity to major special effects</em>?</p>
<p>More likely, Marshall knew, as the defendants all basically knew, it was illegal because of the proximity to special effects (even if they believed it wasn’t seriously dangerous). The defendants, however, did have a more plausible claim (than Marshall) to being naive about the seriousness of the crime they were committing. Marshall had more deniability.</p>
<p>This would make any phone call to any Labor authority moot and, obviously, a bad idea with regards to drawing unnecessary attention to the production.</p>
<p>But, then, if Marshall knew it wouldn’t be allowed and reported an approximation (“8:00 or 8:30”), why (in doing so) did he misrepresent it to the defendants as a matter of the hour, and not proximity to special effects (in effect normalizing to the defendants the relevant, unstated, violation)?</p>
<p>And why, anyway, would Marshall facilitate a hiring he knew to be illegal rather than saying, “get inventive; use dummies”?</p>
<p>Was he that willing to go to bat for the creative vision of a director, John Landis, whom he knew to be a complete liability?</p>
<p>Was getting the children into the scene that important?</p>
<p>Was there some reason they needed a close-up of a girl holding a doll?</p>
</section><section id="item2"><p>2. Amount Folsey, Jr., had promised out before July 22nd</p>
<p>Schuman and Nigh heard Folsey, Jr., speaking to parents over the phone.</p>
<p>Schuman said she never heard Folsey mention a helicopter in those conversations, in which he was always specific about the money being offered: $500 if the child was hired, $100 to stand by, and $25 for an audition with Landis. (LaBrecque 143)</p>
<p>The Le family reported being told that several children, not just theirs, had auditioned for the roles:</p>
<p>The driver told us, “Why don't we stay here and wait? I go and look for the people who will interview the children." And I said, "What are they? What's their name?" I know nothing about (inaudible), even movie actors, I don't know much about. "Who are they? What do they do? What's their name?" He said, "I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm new. They just call me to work for them."<br/>DL: Was anybody else with you and Mr. and Mrs. Chen?</p>
<p>Mrs. Le: Only Mr. and Mrs. Chen and Rene and My-Ca and the driver and myself.</p>
<p>And when we got there, they said to have a drink and sit there and wait. Then I saw a group of men, you know, who wore the costume of the KKK.</p>
<p>DL: Yes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Le: Right. And they said, "Where are the other children?" One man asked me that. "Where are the other children?" I said, "What? Who are the other children? What are you talking about?" I said. "Last night, a whole bunch of kids, look like your children, they were here." I said, "What?" "More than twenty were here last night?" And I said, "I don't know. I know nothing. I don't even know who I'm going to see."</p>
<p>So I sit there and wait for about fifteen, twenty minutes, and George Folsey came out and introduced himself, and he took me to the place where they shoot the movie. And he stood there and explained to me what they were doing there, with the KKK group, and then they burned a cross and we were watching, and they were filming it. I met his wife and met John's brother, I believe John Landis [sic]. Do you know him?</p>
<p>[<em>Sean Daniel</em>? Universal Studios Production Executive, Landis’s close personal friend?]</p>
</section><section id="item3"><p><img src="./img/image2.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is significant because many crew did indeed bring their families for the family day and scheduled final day of the shoot (traditionally its “wrap”), as word had travelled about the big spectacle written into the story. The children were able to mingle with the spectators on the first night without attracting notice. (Tice made this point in his testimony.)</p>
</section><section id="item4"><p>4. LaBrecque conjecture?</p>
<p>Exact starting point, which is disputed, (could’ve changed the angle of the spotlight ergo the helicopter elevation required to track Vic and the children.)</p>
<p><img src="./img/image3.jpg"/></p>
<p><img src="./img/image4.jpg"/></p>
<p>If the helicopter was originally at <strong>40 feet</strong> in altitude and the tracked point shifts <strong>10 feet to the right</strong>, the new lateral distance increases from xx to x+10x+10. Since the angle of elevation follows tan⁡(θ)=hdtan(θ)=dh​ and d=(x+10)2+y2d=(x+10)2+y2​, increasing dd generally <strong>lowers</strong> the required altitude to maintain a similar tracking angle. Using the small-shift approximation Δh≈10⋅hxΔh≈x10⋅h​, if x=50x=50 feet and h=40h=40 feet, the expected <strong>decrease</strong> in altitude would be around <strong>8 feet</strong>, making the new preferred altitude <strong>about 32 feet</strong>. (ChatGPT)</p>
</section><section id="item5"><p>5. Scene 32 &amp; 34 (Shed pick-ups)</p>
<p>The production intended to get a quick pair of pick-up shots after the 2:20am shot, namely Scenes 32 &amp; 34 (33 having already been filmed).</p>
<p>32 ASIAN RIVER - NIGHT<br/>The helicopter spots them and guns blazing, heads toward the river. As Bill carrying the kids desperately makes his way through the water, the helicopter makes several passes strafing the area. Bill makes it to shore and sees a wooden shed. Making a super-human attempt he manages to get all three of them inside. He stacks the wood inside against the door, then huddles with the kids in the corner.</p>
<p>BILL<br/>(breathless)<br/>Don’t worry you guys. I won’t let them hurt you.</p>
<ol>
<li>EXT. SHED - THE WOODS - NIGHT</li>
</ol>
<p>The shed is now in the pine woods. Dogs barking, torches burning.</p>
<p>The-picks-ups arrive. The Klan surrounds the small shed.</p>
<p>K.K.K. #1<br/>We got us a n***** in the wood pile!</p>
<p>K.K.K. #3<br/>Let’s burn him!</p>
<p>K.K.K. #2<br/>No, I want him alive. His black ass is mine.</p>
<p>Grabbing axes they start chopping down the door.</p>
<p>34 INT. SHED - NIGHT<br/>The door begins to splinter under the axes. The door shutters and the Nazi soldiers grab Bill and pull him out.</p>
<p>We know this because the Extras playing the two Nazi soldiers were in attendance for the accident.</p>
<p>These scenes are significant for providing plausible deniability to Dick Vane, the locations manager, who was the highest ranking member of the production to admit to participating in a conspiracy to conceal the children from a fire safety officer and welfare worker. He was able at the Grand Jury hearing to both (1) admit he was actively participating in the conspiracy at the time of the accident (2:20am); and (2) claim that he, and Frank Marshall—standing beside him—didn’t believe the children were going to be used in the shot. Vane was able to say that he believed the concealment plan was ongoing for the sake of the last two “shed” pick-up shots (Scene 32 &amp; 34).</p>
<p>But was it true?</p>
<p>Tice told the Grand Jury that Vane checked on his whereabouts three times in the lead-up to the 2:20am shot specifically.</p>
<p>Did someone have conversations with you on Thursday that in retrospect you now think were somewhat out of the ordinary or order?</p>
<p>“Yes, Richard Vane wanted to know where I Was going to be during the filming of the 2:30 scene… he asked me that on three occasions. I think it was unusual. I did not think much of it at the time, but afterwards I thought it was quite unusual. And the reason for it is because the fire deputy had— we had six firemen there, and we were coordinating the fire efforts, representing the county fire department. And it was quite unusual for him to insist on knowing where I was going to be.”</p>
</section><section id="item6"><p>6. "So I got him a car."</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry from the NTSB, following sworn testimony by an unreliable witness (an SFX truck driver, Carl Pittman, who’d admitted to being drunk among other liabilities) that Spielberg had been on set and asked him to call his <em>limousine</em> in the aftermath of the accident (LaBrecque 76; only LaBrecque specifies limousine rather than car, and he doesn’t explain).</p>
<p>Two other items of trivia/hearsay, from Chain:</p>
<p>{i} On July 15th, the Thursday night that Landis auditioned the Hua family at the Franklin Reservoir, Folsey, Jr. “created a sensation on the rundown street by pulling up in a limo.” (Ch. 24) [Like a scene out of Blank Check.]</p>
<p>{ii} Warner Bros. studio heard a rumour that Spielberg interviewed the children on the Twilight Zone set a week before the crash. (Ch. 26)</p>
</section><section id="item7"><p>7. Morey on Spielberg (Grand Jury, June 1st, 1983) (Summary/Notes by courtroom stenographer)</p>
<p>D.A. (GK): Who represented the John Landis production staff at those meetings?</p>
<p>EM: The executive producer frank marshall; the associate producer George Folsey Jr.; the production manager Dan Allingham; I think Bonnie Radford was there. Landis wasn’t at those meets. Never met him.</p>
<p>D.A.: Was it your understanding that Frank Marshall was simply lending his name to this production, but in essence the individuals who were running the show so to speak were John Landis and George Folsey?</p>
<p>EM: Yes, I think Frank Marshall was really representing Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Spielberg’s 40th Birthday (actually 41st). (See <strong>McBride</strong>.)</p>
<p>"...First he worked on my dolls. He’d act out a Jack LaLanne scene, an exercise story, and then he’d rip their legs off, throw them against the wall, and beat them up until all the stuffing came out."</p>
<p>“We have a daughter, Janice, and he tore the head off her Barbie doll,” suggesting the symbol, while general, at least had personal resonance.</p>
