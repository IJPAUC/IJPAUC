Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, creating procedural confusion and weakening investigative authority. With no single agency clearly in charge, influential witnesses&mdash;particularly production and studio executives&mdash;had greater latitude to maneuver, delay cooperation, and exploit jurisdictional gaps, significantly limiting the police and prosecutors&#39; leverage in the critical early stages. By the time the NTSB and Cal/OSHA completed their investigations at the end of 1982, only a single detective and a single D.A. remained to build the criminal case, severely disadvantaged against a formidable legal defense team funded by studios and insurers motivated to avoid a windfall in the pending civil trial. Although the prosecution nearly collapsed due to a lack of witness testimony&mdash;several witnesses later testified about serious threats of blacklisting&mdash;a breakthrough in early 1983 enabled the D.A. to successfully navigate the case through a Grand Jury hearing (June 1983), a preliminary hearing (February 1984), and an appeal (November 1984), until the defense had exhausted all legal options.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Finally, in a landmark trial in 1986-87, co-producer/writer/director, John Landis (</span><span class="c7 c8">Animal House, The Blues Brothers</span><span class="c5">), along with two production subordinates, and two technicians, faced Involuntary Manslaughter charges for the deaths. Landis and his Associate Producer and Production Manager&mdash;who faced two counts specifically for the illegal hiring&mdash;conceded that they decided to hire the children without permits but said they only did so because of the late hour, not because they ever seriously believed the scene was dangerous as planned. The filmmakers were eventually acquitted, with the civil case settled during closing arguments for approximately $2-million dollars per family.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The verdict vindicated Landis and his Hollywood allies in their assertion that the accident had been unforeseeable:</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_ze1rf0w0nvw3-0 start"><li class="c0 c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;...an industrial accident, nothing more.&rdquo; (Landis regular, Dan Aykroyd)</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_ze1rf0w0nvw3-0"><li class="c0 c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;...obviously a human catastrophe&hellip; not a criminal act.&rdquo; (Universal Studios Production Executive, Sean Daniel)</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_ze1rf0w0nvw3-0"><li class="c0 c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">&ldquo;...a terrible tragedy [&hellip;] terrible and horrible for everybody.

Myriad evidence went missing, including one of the shot&rsquo;s two audio recordings; the on-set photographer&rsquo;s negatives; all of the producer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making Of&rdquo; documentary footage, except for a single shot of a technical rehearsal; several &ldquo;thumbnail sketches&rdquo;; and all graphic and visual materials relating to the film&rsquo;s production, except for a single bird&rsquo;s eye diagram of the set known as &ldquo;the spotting plan,&rdquo; which &ldquo;by some ungodly coincidence&rdquo; included a depiction of a helicopter </span><span class="c7 c9 c8">which had already crashed</span><span class="c1">. The defence resisted turning over even this lone, well-corroborated image to the NTSB until the matter was escalated to a federal court.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9">As well&mdash;most significantly, for our purposes&mdash;a man who turned out to be one of the case&rsquo;s key witnesses&mdash;the movie&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c9">Executive Producer, Frank Marshall (</span><span class="c7 c9 c8">Raiders of the Lost Ark, Poltergeist</span><span class="c7 c9">)</span><span class="c7 c9">&mdash;managed to avoid speaking with investigators throughout the case&rsquo;s five years. Marshall was informed about Landis&rsquo;s intentions by a casting agent over a month in advance; whose signature appears on the cheque used to pay the children for their first night of work; whose accountant was reported by a production assistant to have provided her an envelope full of cash on the day of the second night; who was on-set both nights the children were there, including during earlier shots with the children which also constituted legal violations; who ordered the set cleared; and who was documented by Landis&rsquo;s secretary as raiding Landis&rsquo;s office for production materials the morning after the accident. Landis even testified that Marshall </span><span class="c7 c9 c8">explicitly approved the illegal hiring</span><span class="c1">, a narrative maintained by Landis&rsquo;s two subordinates. This is especially significant since Marshall was an executive officer at both Twilight Zone Productions, and the payroll company contracted by Warner Bros to act as a watchdog on the production&rsquo;s spending, which, legally-speaking, made him a major person of interest. Domestic and international subpoenas were issued for Marshall&rsquo;s testimony, but Marshall spent most of the next four years overseas and out of reach. By the time Marshall finally surfaced, as the result of an Interpol &ldquo;Stop and Hold&rdquo; order, the prosecution and defense had already rested their cases, and his testimony was no longer of any use.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 263.10px; height: 226.18px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 263.10px; height: 226.18px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Frank Marshall, Photographed in France, 1985.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">The </span><span class="c7 c8">Twilight Zone</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;tragedy has been analyzed in three excellent books&mdash;</span><span class="c7 c8">Special Effects </span><span class="c7">(LaBrecque, 1988); </span><span class="c7 c8">Outrageous Conduct</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;(Farber and Green, 1988); and </span><span class="c7 c8">Fly by Night </span><span class="c5">(Chain, 2022)&mdash;all written by journalists who attended the trial.

Although the two first met at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard in 1974, when Landis was considered as a screenwriter for what would become </span><span class="c7 c8">Close Encounters</span><span class="c7">, they only became friendly in 1978, after Spielberg reached out to Landis following the success of </span><span class="c7 c8">Animal House</span><span class="c7">. As detailed by Chain (Ch. 6) the two exhibited behaviour reflective of a passive-aggressive friendship, with Landis perceiving that Spielberg had used some of his ideas for </span><span class="c7 c8">Close Encounters </span><span class="c5">without compensation at a time in his career when he was desperate for an opportunity. In her notorious Hollywood tell-all, Julia Phillips claimed: &ldquo;Steven hated him, although Michael and I always wondered if he felt threatened, Landis being so child-prodigy and all, Steven pretty much feeling he had the corner on that arena. There&rsquo;s always someone younger than you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">According to accounts of the early stages of production, Spielberg was heavily invested in the development of the film, both as a whole, and with regards to his own originally-planned sequence. Prior to the accident, the </span><span class="c7 c8">Twilight Zone </span><span class="c7">segments were going to be more continuous and less discrete than they ended up becoming, with recurring characters, seamless segues, and winks to earlier sequences, according to Joe Dante (</span><span class="c7 c8">Gremlins</span><span class="c7">), the director of the movie&rsquo;s third sequence. George Miller (</span><span class="c7 c8">Mad Max</span><span class="c5">), the director of the fourth sequence, said that when he was brought on the project in May, he met with Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy, indicating that the project was on everyone&rsquo;s radar.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">As well, by 1982, Spielberg was in a state of self-described filmmaking mania.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7"><a class="c21" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/iM-SYk0JAuU?si%3DQUMUR32_xKjzPOS7%26t%3D101&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1744473773556985&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fptOKIVhZd8DOdsBuBCVe">60 Minutes Australia, 1982</a></span><span class="c5">:</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c5">&hellip;And all of a sudden I realized that I was a non-entity.

It&rsquo;s unlikely the studio would have released the trailer without Spielberg&rsquo;s approval. Spielberg took out his own two ads (see adjacent).

Marshall (age 36) had recently co-founded Amblin Entertainment, Ltd., with his girlfriend, Kathleen Kennedy (age 27), and their boss and friend, Steven Spielberg. When they met, Spielberg&rsquo;s career was at a turning point. His last three movies, </span><span class="c7 c8">Jaws </span><span class="c7">(1975), </span><span class="c7 c8">Close Encounters of the Third Kind </span><span class="c7">(1977), and </span><span class="c7 c8">1941 </span><span class="c7">(1979), had all gone way over time and budget; this had been fine, until Spielberg&rsquo;s first major bid at comedy, </span><span class="c7 c8">1941, </span><span class="c7">flopped both critically and commercially. Spielberg consciously shifted gears starting with </span><span class="c7 c8">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span><span class="c7">, with newly disciplined production procedures, lead by Marshall&mdash;whom Spielberg remembered favorably from a passing encounter on the set of a Peter Bogdanovich movie in 1974&mdash;and Kennedy, who had only been a Production Assistant on </span><span class="c7 c8">1941</span><span class="c7">, but had impressed Spielberg with her creative story suggestions, and took it upon herself to organize his notes. Not only was </span><span class="c7 c8">Raiders </span><span class="c7">a massive success, but </span><span class="c7 c8">Poltergeist</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7 c8">E.T.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;would also be released within the same year-long period. Amblin had plans to produce swaths of children&rsquo;s and family programming throughout the 1980s.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Beyond negligently facilitating the hiring unwittingly despite being warned, Marshall is implicated in consciously facilitating the hiring, by the actions of Twilight Zone production accountant, Bonne Radford. Radford worked on the Warner Bros lot, in close contact with Marshall; while Landis and his group worked out of an assembly of trailers on the Universal Studios lot. Amblin would only move their offices from the </span><span class="c7">Warner Bros lot </span><span class="c7">to its </span><span class="c10 c7"><a class="c21" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/03/21/steven-spielberg-profile-schindlers-list&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1744473773565538&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DPKDTTXDbUivlyRSEUY1l">final location</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;on the Universal lot in 1984.

She is also reported to have given a Production Assistant an envelope full of cash from an address on the Warner Bros lot the day before the accident. If these witnesses are to be believed, then on whose authority was Radford facilitating this illegal act? It&rsquo;s unlikely she would have done so on behalf of the Associate Producer or Landis. And if Marshall&mdash;as stands to reason&mdash;told her to do it, then who told Marshall?

Sometime earlier&mdash;around 4:00am, according to Landis&mdash;the 1st AD informed him it would not be possible to complete the three major special effects setups and various pick-ups they still had left on the schedule to shoot. Landis said he confirmed it with Marshall. It was only then as they were wrapping up that the Associate Producer, as he was paying the parents out in cash, asked them if they could come back the next night. He said that they would finish up &ldquo;first thing,&rdquo; within an hour or an hour and a half.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">That evening, Marshall was on-set at 9:30pm to witness the first of the two shots involving the children that night.</span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.67px; height: 438.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.gif" style="width: 584.67px; height: 438.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c16 c8">2 of 3 camera angles recovered from the 9:</span><span class="c16 c8">30pm</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;shot, at which time Marshall was present and, according to Chain, so was Kennedy (Chain Ch. 47).

Twice (before the shot and during) Morrow was observed by those present to drop (before/run-through) Myca, and (during) Renee into the water.

Simple interviews with Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy would reveal that these highly placed and acknowledged experts knew that a scene was being shot in their own movie in which actors were being used in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. These participants knew the elements of the scene and would have stopped the production had they ever thought that special effects could not be safely used with actors and helicopters. For Kesselman to have pursued the conspiracy to employ minors without a permit would have resulted in the destruction of his manslaughter case against the five targeted defendants.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c5">Frank Marshall was on the set on the night of the accident as well as on the previous night. Marshall saw the children present and saw them in the 9:30 shot in which they were held by Vic Morrow in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. Marshall was present the whole evening and observed the 11:30 sequence involving Morrow, the 2:00 rehearsal as well as the scene in which the accident occurred. Marshall was the producer of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and participated at meetings in which the hiring of the children was discussed and agreed upon. Since the statute of limitations has now expired, he has no fifth amendment right and if asked will hopefully tell the truth. But what must be emphasized again is the fact that his participation in the hiring of the children without permits was viewed as a &quot;technical&quot; violation that in no way meant that anyone was in danger.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c5">Marshall and Kennedy could verify that Kennedy called the Department of Labor to determine whether permits could be obtained for minors after hours. It was only after her call received a negative response, that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Again, Ms. Kennedy had no belief that there was any danger even though she was intimately acquainted with the nature of the shot and the use of the children. In fact, she was on the set the prior night when the scenes filmed on the fatal night were scheduled to be shot.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c5">With respect to Mr. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy will be able to state whether he knew that children were to be employed without permits. It could be reasonably inferred that given the close relationship between Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy and Spielberg&rsquo;s close supervision of his own movies, that it would be almost inconceivable that Marshall and Kennedy would not tell Spielberg that children were to be employed without permits on Spielberg&rsquo;s own movie.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c5">Your office&#39;s statement that there was an exhaustive investigation is not only false with respect to Marshall, but is also false with respect to Spielberg. Spielberg was able to deflect the investigation away from himself by simply submitting a letter stating that he was not on the set the night of the accident. His full and complete knowledge and approval of what was to take place must be assumed and never has been disputed.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c5">What other major witness could avoid questioning by signing a piece of paper? Your office never asked Spielberg a single question about the accident or the hiring of the children. Your claim that Spielberg was &quot;unavailable&quot; is simply false.</span></p><p class="c25 c4"><span class="c7">Associate Producer Kathleen Kennedy (Spielberg segment) herself made the blind call to the Department of Labor. It was only when she received a negative reply to a question of getting permits for night work that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Kennedy was on the set the night before the accident when the children were present and the special effects were being set up while the helicopter rehearsed. Why has she not been interviewed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Spielberg (or his representatives) gave four statements directed to the matter over the years. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">First, in response to the Chen family civil lawsuit filed on August 2nd, 1982: &ldquo;Spielberg is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at the time and place of the events complained of, plaintiffs and each of them were not exercising ordinary care, caution or prudence to prevent the injuries sustained by them or by decedent and that, therefore, the injuries alleged were proximately caused by the negligence or comparative negligence of the plaintiffs.&quot; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Second, in response to the NTSB interview of a special effects truck driver on November 5th, 1982:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c7">Mr. Pitman [sic] stated that following the crash scene, he had assisted Mr. Landis and one of the children&#39;s parents in obtaining a </span><span class="c7 c17">vehicle**</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to leave the set, and likewise, had secured a vehicle for STEVEN SPIELBERG to leave the set. Following this he left the set, driving the 10-ton powder truck followed by Ted, who was driving the special effects pickup truck. He stated that both of them drove directly to the Burbank Studios. He stated that it was the following day when he and members of the special effects crew met at the Burbank Studios and off-loaded material. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">But Pittman&rsquo;s testimony was dubious, as he&rsquo;d already admitted to being drunk on set. So of course he must &nbsp;be lying.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Spielberg replied to the NTSB&rsquo;s inquiry on the matter by way of a signed affidavit: </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c7">In response to your request, I was never at the Indian Dunes location of </span><span class="c7 c8">Twilight Zone </span><span class="c5">on the night of the accident or at any other time.

The question of whether Marshall knew the children were going to be used not only for the 9:30pm shot, but the 2:20am shot as well is unclear. The Locations Manager, Richard Vane, who had worked with Marshall on </span><span class="c7 c8">Poltergeist</span><span class="c5">, testified once, at the Grand Jury, that during the final shot Marshall, who was standing beside him, turned to say, &ldquo;those are dolls he&rsquo;s picking up, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; But Vane was the highest ranking member of the production to admit to participating in a conspiracy to conceal the presence of the children from a particular Fire Safety Officer known to be trained as an on-set Teacher and Child Welfare Worker, up to and including the 2:20am shot.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Spielberg never distanced himself from Marshall despite the negligence or subpoenas.

In the story, Morrow&rsquo;s character&mdash;an embittered bigot&mdash;delivers a tirade to his friends in a bar, and then steps out into Nazi-occupied France. Shortly, he is mistaken for Jewish and chased by the officers, before time-jumping again to the deep south, where he continues to be chased, but now by the KKK. Next, he finds himself in Vietnam, where he finds himself set upon&mdash;not by Vietnamese soldiers, who pass by his hiding spot&mdash;but by U.S. infantry. He is finally buffeted back to the Nazi timeline, where he is hauled to a half-filled freight car headed for the death camps. He reaches out of the slats to his friends, whom he can now see stumbling out of the bar, but they can&rsquo;t hear his cries.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Landis testified that the recurring complaint he received from the Warner Brothers Executive class, as filtered to him through Director of Creative Lucy Fisher, was that the story was just too darn cynical.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Landis complained that he wrote it in the spirit of the original series, which, as we all recall, was all about morals this, and morals that.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose, can we glean any from pre-production?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every story needs a good MacGuffin.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Broken and Naked Barbie Doll?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like a busted up Oscar Statuette?
