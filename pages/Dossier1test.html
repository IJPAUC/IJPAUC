      <p>Investigator Budds observed the location to be a movie set within the Indian Dunes Park. The movie set depicted a Vietnamese village constructed at the base of an approximately 100-foot-high, sheer-faced cliff. The Santa Clara River ran in an east-west direction adjacent to and just north of the simulated village. This river had been enlarged by the formation of a man-made dam west of the village. This dam was downstream, which caused the river to back up, widening and deepening the normal river size. (Police Report)</p>

            <p>Bill comes out from the swamp onto the. Banks of the fairly wide river. Across the water he sees some sort of village, thatched buildings, maybe nine or ten of them. Light bulbs loosely strung on wires hang between the huts illuminating the sparse community at the base of the cliff on the water.</p>
            <p>Bill cautiously moves towards the village.</p>

            <p>Bill carefully enters the area but finds no one. The place is deserted.

      <p>After two children were written into the third draft of Landis’s script on June 12th, 1982, Landis, and two of his co-defendants—Associate Producer, George Folsey, Jr., and Unit Production Manager, Dan Allingham—became aware that young children were going to be needed for the newly added helicopter attack-and-rescue sequence.</p>

      <h4>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 16th</h4>
      <p>Associate casting agent, Marci Liroff, of Fenton & Fineberg Casting, although just 24-years-old, had already worked with Amblin Entertainment twice before, on <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.</span></p>
      <p>On July 7th, 1983, police investigators spoke with Liroff, who said:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">

         <p>... on 6/16/82 she had been one of four people at a "Casting Session" which took place in John Landis' office at Universal Studios. Present at the casting session were herself, her boss (Mike Fenton), George Folsey, and John Landis. During this session, Mr. Landis explained to everyone present that the character ("Bill") being portrayed by VICTOR MORROW in the Landis episode was coming across too harsh in the movie. Mr. Landis said that during the previous evening, he had come up with an idea, "softening Morrow's character." Mr. Landis explained that his idea included Vic Morrow running across a river at night being pursued by a helicopter which would be firing simulated machine gunfire. As Mr. Morrow was running across the river, he would be carrying two children. This scene was supposed to depict Vic Morrow rescuing these two Vietnamese children as a Vietnamese Village was under attack. Mr. Landis continued that, as Mr. Morrow crossed the river carrying the two children, numerous large explosions would be occurring to either side and to the front and back of the actors.</p>
         <p>Mr. Landis told Ms. Liroff that they wanted her to obtain two children, Vietnamese, Korean or Thai, approximately 6 or 7 years of age, for use in the aforementioned scene. </p>
         <div class="largequote">
            <p>Ms. Liroff stated that she explained to Mr. Landis that based on the description of the scene, it was her impression that the scene was very dangerous and, in fact, too dangerous to use children. </p>
         </div>
         <p>She stated that based on the children being in close proximity to explosions and close proximity to a helicopter, there was no way she would be involved in hiring the children.</p>
         <p>She also explained that because of the danger, there was no way they could obtain necessary permits through the normal channels. She stated that she continued explaining to Mr. Landis and those present that additionally, the entire scene was to be shot in the late night and early morning hours and for that reason and in addition to the danger, there was no way proper permits could be obtained. Ms. Liroff continued by telling Mr. Landis that she would not be involved with the procurement of the children for this scene. She stated that her boss, Mike Fenton, concurred with her.</p>
         <p>Ms. Liroff continued that John Landis, after receiving her refusal to obtain the children, immediately turned towards George Folsey and began to hold a conversation with him. During this time, Dan Allingham entered the office. Ms. Liroff stated that Landis, Folsey, and Allingham began having a conversation about hiring children in spite of the fact that they couldn't get them through normal legal channels.</p>
         <div class="largequote">
            <p id="bookmark-001">She stated that John Landis told Folsey and Allingham that they would "just have to get the kids off the street, we won't put them on any records and we won't tell anyone what we're doing."</p>
         </div>
         <p>She recalls that George Folsey commented something to the effect, "Okay fine, that's how we'll do it."</p>
      </div>
      <p>Liroff supplied the police with her casting notes for the day, where she’d written, “Two Vietnamese kids, boy&girl (Chinese or Korean, Thai. Two nights.)”</p>
      <p>Besides substantiating that Landis had asked them to procure children at all (which Landis denied), it also established that the filmmakers believed that the shooting would or could take “two nights.” This is significant because the parents were only given an abridged version of the sequence before committing, and told they would only be needed between 7:00pm and 1:00am on a single night. But once they arrived on set, the filmmakers repeatedly extended their time commitment, past the point where all four working parents were able to supervise their children as planned, and to the point of exhaustion. Along with the misrepresentation of the danger involved, then, the misrepresentation of the time commitment—if it was known or anticipated by any of the key figures involved—is a significant issue in assessing culpability.</p>

      <p>At the preliminary hearing in 1984, Liroff went on the record about the involvement of Executive Producer Frank Marshall.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://youtu.be/ixARhgXRsAQ?si=bqhJT189AZjxn4Su&t=574">testified</a> that two days after the alarming casting session, during a scheduled production phone call with Marshall, whom she knew from her work on <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, she alerted him to Landis’s explicitly-stated intentions to hire children “off the street.” </p>
      <p>Marshall told her he would take care of it.</p>
      <h4>TUESDAY, JULY 6th</h4>
      <p>The issue of the children lay dormant for the rest of June.</p>
      <p>Twilight Zone Productions shot Landis’s prologue to the film, “Real Scary,” at the end of June, with a few hiccups, while production of Landis’s segment started July 1st.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the new Village rescue sequence was still awaiting official studio approval. It required a $200,000 addition to the segment’s planned $1,000,000 budget (Chain Ch. 18). Landis had turned in a final draft on June 26th, 1982, but it contained only <a href="#bookmark=id.wmsay4uezx1q">a few adjustments, of little apparent significance.</a></p>
      <p>After the production got notice that the budget had been officially approved by the studio, <a href="#bookmark=id.r9xokggd0mi3">the account of how the hiring proceeded varies</a>.</p>
      <p>The problem was that according to California state labor laws, children under the age of 8 could only be worked until 6:30pm. </p>
      <p>Marshall has never spoken on record about the hiring. Landis, Folsey Jr., and Allingham, for their part, have consistently maintained that after the budget was approved, Marshall twice visited their offices on the Universal Studios lot to address the practical issue presented by the writing of two children into the script (namely, scenes 29-32).</p>
      <p>The discussion, they say, turned on whether it would be possible for the production to get waivers from the labor board that would allow the children to work at night legally.</p>
      <p>According to the defendants, Marshall said he would have “the woman who works with me call the labor board and see about the viability of getting waivers” (Braun’s 1985 letters to the D.A. and opening statement (as Folsey’s lawyer)</a>; see LaBrecque 13).</p>

      <h4>FRIDAY, JULY 9th</h4>
      <p>On Friday the 9th, they say, Marshall returned to the offices and informed them that the call had been made and waivers could only be gotten until 8:00 or 8:30pm. However, this being July, it wouldn’t even be dark by 8:00 or 8:30pm.</p>
      <div class="largequote">
         <p>So that the children could work despite the late hour, the co-defendants decided to go ahead with Landis’s plan to hire children—they say—with Marshall’s explicit support.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Specifically, Landis testified that:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>“Frank told us that they had called the labour board and the labour board said they would give a waiver but only until eight or eight-thirty, which to our purposes then, our state of mind then, wouldn't accomplish what we needed because it was still light at eight-thirty.”</p>
         <p>“Was any decision made at this time regarding the use of children?”</p>
         <p>“Yes.”</p>
         <p>“What was that decision, John?”</p>
         <p>“We decided to break the law. We decided, wrongly, to violate the labor code.”</p>
         <p>“John, what was your thinking at that time?”</p>
         <p>“I thought, and we discussed, that we would honor not the letter of the law but the spirit of the law. And I thought, and we discussed, that we would find children whose parents—we would explain to them that we were doing a technical violation, that we were working them without a teacher on the set—explain to them what we were going to do. And if we could find people who would fulfill that function as we thought, and I can only speak for my state of mind then, and I understand that was wrong—but we decided to go ahead and try to find parents who would fulfill that, what I thought would be the spirit of the law, and be the guardians, be there with them on the set.”</p>
         <p>“John, that was wrong. You recognize that?”</p>
         <p>“Yes.”</p>
         <p>“Out of this meeting or as a result of this meeting, John, was anybody given the task of obtaining the children?”</p>
         <div class="largequote">
            <p>Frank [Marshall] and George [Folsey, Jr.] volunteered to try and find people.</p>
         </div>
      </div>
      <p>In the end, the task fell to Folsey.</p>
      <p>Folsey later told LaBrecque: </p>
      <div class="blockquote largequote">
         <p>We wouldn’t have hired the kids on a Spielberg picture unless either Spielberg or his people knew it. I mean, that would have been a terrible thing to do, put them in that position. The fact that Frank [Marshall] agreed to do it made me feel that it was okay, that it was really his responsibility, too. (14)</p>
      </div>
      <p>(And legally speaking, Folsey turned out to be correct—a point confirmed by Allingham’s attorney in 1985</a>. According to standards set by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), the production company was deemed the sole employer of minors and crew members, with liability for their employment and supervision falling squarely on the company’s officers.)</p>
      <p>The production had less than two weeks before the children were needed on the shoot’s last scheduled day, July 21st. Folsey, however, already had a few leads.</p>
      <p>After the 3rd draft had been typed back in June, Landis ordered his secretary (Alpha Campbell) to keep it under lock and key. But this created a bottleneck as various production personnel attempted to get a copy of the latest draft from the production coordinator (Donna Schuman) who, herself, had already been denied by Campbell. Schuman asked Folsey directly about the reason for the secrecy, and he said, </p>
      <div class="blockquote largequote">
         <p>‘Because John has written two children into the script. We’re going to have to work them without permits. And we don’t want that information getting out.’ (qtd. in F&G 70)</p>
      </div>
      <p>The conspiracy soon expanded to include a production secretary (Cynthia Nigh); the 1st AD (Elie Cohn); the 2nd AD (Anderson House); and an intern from the Director’s Guild of America (Hilary Leach) who were aware of the break from standard practice.</p>
      <p>In Leach’s words, “as a member...  of the DGA we know the rules, I know the rules, and I knew that we were not following the rules” (GJ 1983). </p>
      <p>She found out a few days before scenes and talked to Anderson House about it. He expressed reservations: “he was concerned for safety in the water for the children, since it did involve some shallow water, and he was concerned that the children were being used at all in a scene that had some loud noises, big lights, flames, special effects.</p>
      <p>Again, comprehension of the seriousness of the action they were entering into varied, with many of those who participated unaware of how Landis intended to shoot the scene. Schuman assumed that the children would obviously not be placed in any proximity to the massive pyrotechnics spectacle Landis had been hyping-up around the office for weeks.</p>
      <p>At Folsey’s request, Schuman even volunteered her husband (Dr. Hal Schuman) as a bridge to L.A.’s Asian community. He had previously managed a community mental health center predominantly serving Asian clientele and knew several of the doctors still working there.</p>

      <h4>MONDAY, JULY 12th</h4>
      <p>Dr. Hal Schuman called Dr. Peter Chen. He kept it brief, explaining that his wife worked for Warner Brothers and the production was looking for two Asian children, boy and girl, ages 6 to 8, to be carried across a river by an actor, along with a few close-ups. He was calling to ask if Dr. Chen knew of any suitable families that might be interested in participating.</p>
      <p>Dr. Chen thought about his own 6-year-old niece, Renee, and referred Dr. Schuman to his colleague, Dr. Daniel Le, a former Vietnamese refugee himself, who had two sons, 4-year-old Christopher, and 7-year-old Myca.</p>
      <p>Dr. Chen relayed the opportunity to his brother and Dr. Le, respectively, who each presented it to their children, who loved the idea. They confirmed their interest with Dr. Schuman, who relayed an invitation to visit the set to meet the producers (Landis and Folsey), who would give them more details and answer any of their questions. The studio would send a van for them two days later on Friday, July 16th.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Folsey’s search had taken him to an elementary school in a then-predominantly Asian neighborhood (Echo Park) where he was put in touch with Ms. Julie Hua, and her sister who, between them, had six children and a niece suitable for the parts. They were invited to the set the following night, Thursday, July 15th—the evening before the Chens and Les were set to arrive.</p>
      <p>Folsey picked up the two women and seven children in a limo (Chain 133), and accompanied them across town to Franklin Canyon Park, near to the Warner Bros and Universal Studios. The bona fide Warner Bros. film set was buzzing with about one-hundred cast, crew, and guests. The production at the time was filming an earlier sequence <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYV28UZJoX8HRayshCIbDCvdAiUAGOPQ8OQR1bZK-zw/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.4w3x3x5ycnt3">where the protagonist finds himself being led by the KKK to a burning cross</a>.</p>
      <p>Landis selected two of Hua’s sister’s children for the roles.</p>

      <h4>FRIDAY, JULY 16th</h4>
      <p>On Friday, July 16th, the Chen and Le families (minus Dr. Le, who was attending a professional workshop) were picked up by a driver in a white van and transported across the city to Franklin Canyon Park for their audition with Landis and Folsey.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the parents arrived, Folsey introduced himself, and then, as they waited for Landis to become available, summarized the sequence.</p>
      <p>This episode is significant because it concerns the manner and extent to which the parents were informed about the scenario, such that they could consent to putting their children at the risk it imposed. Most significantly, both families alleged the filmmakers never mentioned the use of explosives.</p>
      <div class="transcript">
         <p><span class="transcript-name">NTSB:</span> So as far as you knew, the children were only going [to be] carried across the river?”</p>
         <p><span class="transcript-name">Mark Chen:</span> Carried across the river. That’s all. That’s why he said the children didn’t have to speak anything [sic]. The actor just carries the two children across the river.</p>
      </div>
      <p>(Only Mrs. Chen remembered <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hD-9NB4Ek7twylx8SYygTP7byL55p4iiA57CHPJ3Fec/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.r2x92st1wu23">an alternate ending</a>, in which the helicopter lands and picks up Morrow and the children.)</p>
      <p>Folsey maintains that he did tell the families about the explosives, which is consistent with the testimony of other prosecution witnesses who overheard him mentioning explosives while he was on the phone (albeit representing them as a harmless background display, “like fireworks”).</p>
      <p>The matter was fundamentally muddled due to the language barrier, affecting Mrs. Chen and Dr. Le especially. Dr. Le admitted that he hadn’t paid close attention to the details:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>I don't know the law. We are the new immigrants into this country. I trust Dr. Schuman and Mr. [Peter] Chen, what they are doing. I do not question them...  Folsey appeared to be very honest, nice person and I trust him. And I thought in my mind, because I am ignorant about the movie industry in this country, I thought this may be the way the movie industry working at dealings in this country. (qtd. in LaBrecque)</p>
      </div>

      <p>The state can secure an involuntary manslaughter conviction whether or not the defendants knew the extent of the danger they were putting the victims into, so long as their conduct was extremely reckless relative to what would have been expected of a reasonable person in their position. The case only gets stronger as the defendants admit or can be shown to have been aware of the danger.</p>
      <p>The extent to which the defendants really believed that the shot didn’t constitute a meaningful risk to the children is a matter of speculation.</p>
      <p>They claimed at the trial not to have known that permits would never have been granted to the children due to their proximity to major practical effects hazards. More likely, they knew it was prohibited, but were ignorant to the particulars and believed that the technicians involved—the Special Effects team, the stunt coordinator, and the pilot, namely—would ensure the shot went off safely.</p>
      <p>Landis and his production team had gotten as far as they had in Hollywood by <a href="#bookmark=id.7829avrrwvtq">bending and breaking the rules</a>, and Landis began his career as a stuntman; it’s not implausible that he lacked perspective. The theory that Landis was relatively naive includes the way he flaunted his plan in front of two casting agents, or even asked them to cast the parts in the first place.</p>
      <p>Marshall, however, was much more versed in the laws concerning child labour, having just completed <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">E.T.<span class="movietitle">. Landis hardly ever worked with children.</p>
      <h4>SUNDAY, JULY 18th</h4>
      <p>Folsey broke the news to Mrs. Hua on Sunday, July 18th: “Mr. Folsey said in a very low and sorry voice that our children had not been chosen...  He said Mr. Landis had found children younger and smaller. We were very disappointed.” (Qtd. in Farber & Green 116)</p>

      <h4>MONDAY, JULY 19th</h4>
      <p>The production migrated to Indian Dunes on Monday, July 19th. </p>
      <p>That evening, according to the grand jury testimony of 1st AD Elie Cohn, he, Landis, Folsey, and Allingham met to discuss “what day to bring the children, and to make it as short as possible.”</p>

      <p>On the morning of Tuesday, July 20th, a 75-year-old Warner Brothers accountant (Jim Henderling) received a call from Bonne Radford. </p>
      <p>Radford is listed in the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> production directory as its accountant. Also the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0705511/">longtime paymaster/accountant</a> of Amblin Entertainment, and sister of Mary Radford, Marshall’s assistant.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to the deal memo negotiated between Spielberg, Landis, Marshall, and Warner Bros., all production expenses above $500 needed to be co-signed by two safekeepers: Henderling, a 75-year-old payroll watchdog on the Warner Brothers side, and Marshall, as the Executive Producer, on the Twilight Zone Productions side.</p>
      <div class="blockquote largequote">
         <p>Henderling told investigators that Radford asked him “how they could hire children without going through the Screen Extra Guild.”</p>
      </div>
      <p>He told her that he didn’t know, but would make some inquiries. He called the Screen Extra Guild but they were no help.</p>
      <p>He also mentioned the request to his boss, Warner Brothers VP of Production, Ed Morey. But before Henderling could get back to her, she called him first, explaining that they would not be using children in the end after all, so the point was moot. Instead, she asked if Henderling could co-sign a $2,000 cheque payable to George Folsey, Jr., for a “personal cash advance,” that she would courier to him immediately. He said he would ask Morey and call her back. He apprised Morey of the situation and that he suspected the production intended to use the money to hire children illegally. “The whole method seemed unorthodox,” Henderling testified; “I didn’t feel like signing it” (176).</p>
      <p>But Morey advised him that an Associate Producer had every right to request such an advance, and told Henderling to sign the cheque.</p>
      <p>The cheque, with Henderling’s and Marshall’s signatures displayed, became a key piece of evidence linking the production to the hiring.</p>
      <p>Although Marshall maintained that he had no idea what the money was for, Marshall’s account of what happened (or implied account)</a> was directly disputed by Landis, Folsey, and Allingham</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the production had begun shooting the story’s Vietnam sequence, in which Morrow’s character emerges from a jungle swamp before hiding from a Viet Cong patrol behind some reeds. But his rustling is noticed by an U.S. Army patrol, who halt and wait for him to settle before spraying the banana plants with bullets.</p>
      <p>During the production of this scene, Morrow (doing his own stunts) was waiting behind the plants for the signal, at which point he would leap out of the way, and then the special effects team would fire on the vegetation with semi-automatic marble guns. But the pressure was weak enough that they weren’t punching through the plants.</p>
      <p>The Special Effects Coordinator (Paul Stewart) offered to replace them with squibs (small explosives), but when Landis found out that it would take fifteen minutes, Stewart raised the possibility of using live ammunition instead.</p>
      <figure>
         <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bytaNC8TgwJOWLxFKLxxnKi2sQfIg1Sd/view?usp=sharing"><img src="../img/dossier006.gif"></a>
         <figcaption>Several of the crew were alarmed by the use of live-ammunition on-set. Just moments after Morrow dove out of the way, Landis called “fire” and three special effects men fired shotguns at the banana plants. (Clip)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Many of the crew were startled by the practice at the time, even in the context of a shoot already fraught with near-misses, and among Landis’s notoriously rough, ramshackle—and loaded—production team.</p>
      <p>Marshall must have been aware of some of these safety incidents. According to journalist <a href="#bookmark=id.qa3iatob3psm">Steve Chain</a>, in August 1982, Marshall’s lawyers downplayed his involvement to Cal/OSHA, emphasizing the distinction between Spielberg’s group and Landis’s group. They kept separate offices on separate lots. Marshall was dismissed on the basis that he had only been on the set during three of the twelve days of production, when in fact it had been at least eight (Chain Ch. 25).</p>

      <h4>WEDNESDAY, JULY 21st</h4>
      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier007.gif">
         <figcaption>The production had used a bulldozer to dam the Santa Clara river, flooding it into a lake. Morrow would need to run 100 feet to the opposite shore (South to North), where the designated viewing gallery had been set between the Chapman crane and the bulldozer.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As of Wednesday, July 21st, the parents were still under the impression that their obligation was only for 6-hours, between 7:00pm and 1:00am.</p>
      <p>But the schedule they’d been given was ambitious: subsequent to their arrival on-set, the production—still bogged down shooting a tracking shot of Morrow walking into the village—required the children to shoot a dramatically significant scene inside the hut; and then the full rescue/river-crossing sequence, involving three distinct multi-camera helicopter-and-explosives setups, along with <a href="#bookmark=id.u047ucmmdhrx">various pick-ups</a>.</p>
      <p>As well, being the production’s scheduled last day, it was also its designated “family day” and wrap party, further saddling the itinerary. So the schedule was ambitious, especially given the scale of the spectacle Landis had set in motion.</p>
      <p>Both families were bewildered by their sequesterment far from the action, and the long delay, well past their original time commitment.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>When we got there, we were waiting until midnight. What we had been told was the hours we would be there was only from 7 to 1 o'clock in the morning. It's over midnight. We said, “How come, there's nothing to do for our children?” So they say, “Well, just be patient, there will be.” (Mark Chen)</p>
         <p>I keep asking him until now he said “We cannot do it. We have to do it after dinner.” I said, “what you mean by dinner? When is dinner? I never have dinner. A man there said twelve o'clock.” I said “Midnight? Dinner? This is strange to me and I expect he finish before midnight.” but then he said. “We worked day already.” We already got there and what can I say, “No I don't want it? I go home?” I'm not that type woman. He said there's no danger. So we stayed there, we stayed in the mobile home. (Hoa-Kim Le)</p>
      </div>

      <h4>THURSDAY, JULY 22nd</h4>
      <p>By 1:00am, the Special Effects Supervisor (Paul Stewart), told LaBrecque, “I knew by one o'clock that we would never finish,” he told me later. “When you do a motion picture you know the assistant director is gonna say, 'Oh, yeah, we're gonna finish.' But you walk away knowing he's full of it. I know what I gotta do and it's not humanly possible.” (30)</p>
      <p>Folsey was advised by 1st AD Elie Cohn at 2:00am that it would be impossible to complete everything that had been planned for the night.</p>
      <p>Landis testified that, at 4:30am, </p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Elie came to me and said the dolly shot had taken so long and we were behind, and he felt that once we finished the dialogue scene, he recommended that we send the actors home and not rush anything and just go a day over schedule.</p>
         <p>Alright. What did you say about that?</p>
         <div class="largequote">
            <p>I thought it sounded like a good idea and I went to Frank Marshall and George Folsey and we talked about it and agreed to do it.</p>

      <p>The parents were informed and provisionally asked if they would consider returning the following day. Folsey sealed the deal back at the trailer.</p>

         <figcaption>(Click to play) All of them were taken back to the mobile home around 4:00am to 5:00am. That morning George Folsey Jr. related that they would have to come back at 6:00pm that day 7-22-82 and they would be finished quickly. George Folsey handed Mr. Daniel Le an envelope with the names Daniel and Kim on it. Inside were five (5) $100.00 bills. There were no receipts or stubs indicating dates or hours worked. George Folsey, Jr., told them not to tell anyone they got paid—that just to say, if asked, they were helping a friend—that they were just here to help some friends. Jeff [their driver] then took them home around 7:00am. (Excerpt from DLSE summary of their interview with Le family, August 3rd, 1982.)</figcaption>

         <p>MC: It was the first—the face shoot. It looked very simple. You know, they didn't have to talk, they didn't have to open their mouths. They just looked at the actor, Vic Morrow, that's all. When he says it's going to be very quick, they tried to finish earlier, so actually the parents don't have to come, just have the children show up, that's all.</p>
         <p>NTSB: You mean they didn't say anything about any other shot? They were going to re-take the shot, just taking a picture of the children that evening?</p>
         <p>MC: We hadn't seen the actor carry the children across the river. So we know that would be the next shot. After that, that will be completed. They take so long. He says, “Just come back tonight, and they will try to do it as soon as they can.”</p>
         <p>NTSB: Have your child back home, is that what you're saying?</p>
         <p>MC: He said he'd try to make it before 3:30 a.m.</p>
         <p>NTSB: 3:30 in the morning? That would be Friday morning?</p>
         <p>MC: Friday morning. Since I was very tired, so I say okay, I told my wife I'd have her come with Renee. The same thing with Le's family. The father was the one to take My-Ca on Thursday.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The Chen family knew they were committing to another late night, but had no idea that the roll-over day would be of an entirely different tenor, reserved for the segment’s pyrotechnical and helicopter shots.</p>
      <p>The Le family were under the impression they were going to be finished within an hour or two.</p>
      <p>“The first thing” Dr. Le reminded her of the words Folsey used.</p>
      <p>“The first thing tomorrow when you come back,” Mrs. Le said. They would be paid the same rate, $500, even if they finished early.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Le tried to beg out of it, explaining that although their children had enjoyed the experience, they, the parents, were very tired. Folsey had advised them to nap with their children while they weren’t needed but she explained that they had been unable to do so and that—the next day (today) being Thursday—she and her husband had to go to work, and so did Mark Chen.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Mrs. Le: And well we look at each other and said, “I have to work, my husband has to work, and Mark had to return back to work. We cannot bring the children here.”</p>
         <p>And George said, “Well, if you cannot bring the children here, I will pick up the children and bring them here and after the movie I will bring them back, and will treat them like my children. I promise with you.” And after he left there, his children were there too. I met his wife and his boy. He is playing the same as my boy so, well, I thought there was no danger, nothing, just like that. The children happy, giggle, laughing. One more day, maybe. I ask my husband, come back with the boy. ... we will pick you up at six o’clock and we finish early, by hour and a half hour, we finish. (Le NTSB interview)</p>
      </div>
      <p>In the end, the families decided to accommodate the production.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, at the same time, the 2nd AD, Andy House, as he was wrapping up, was recognized by one of the Fire Safety Officers, Jack Tice, who recognized him from a commercial they had worked on together. House couldn’t place him; Tice reminded him that on that project, he (Tice) had been working in his capacity as a Children’s Teacher Welfare worker.</p>
      <p>This was a fateful opportunity, as House had petitioned Allingham and Landis on the illegality of the hiring on <a href="#bookmark=id.aqzjhq9q1fyj">four separate occasions up to this point</a>.</p>
      <p>Tragically, however, when the critical moment arrived, House didn’t tell Tice about the illegal hiring, instead sending a note back to the production office, warning Allingham about a new snag.</p>

      <h4>12:00pm</h4>
      <p>By noon, the crew was arriving back on set.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Mr. Pittman stated in substance that he is a Teamster truck driver and was performing his duties as driver of the special effects 10-ton truck during the filming of the Landis episode of the “Twilight Zone.” Mr. Pittman stated that the afternoon preceding the accident, he arrived on the set at approximately 12:00 o’clock in the afternoon and that prior to arriving at the location, Indian Dunes Park, he had purchased a case of Budweiser beer and soda pop for the special effects crew. He stated that he kept these beverages in a cooler on the back of the 10-ton powder truck. He stated that the 10-ton powder truck was positioned in the area of the Chapman crane and for most of the evening, this is where he spent his time. (police report)</p>
      </div>
      <p>Meanwhile, back at the office, a production assistant, Carolyn Lee-Epstein testified that she was instructed by Folsey or Allingham to go over to the Burbank Studios and contact Bonne Radford to pick up petty cash which was going to be paid to be paid to the oriental children for their participation in the final scene. </p>
      <div class="largequote">
         <p>She was advised by Folsey that “no W-2 forms would be filled out for the children.” </p>
         <p>... Miss Epstein stated that she drove to the Burbank Studios and contacted Bonnie Radford who appeared to be expecting her. She said she picked up petty cash and believed that she had signed for it. She stated that the money was inside a sealed brown envelope. (police report)</p>

      <p>LaBrecque, at least, claims that building was <a href="https://youtu.be/8K1Crn34cEg?si=2auiPNsDI6hhKx-5">Amblin Entertainment</a> (22; cf. 176).</p>
      <p>On Lee-Epstein’s return, she observed the envelope to contain $1,000, intended to pay for the coming night’s work, an amount she’d remembered discussing in the days leading up to the transaction because it sounded like they were getting paid “an awful lot of money.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Allingham got back to House, advising him to tell Vane, who said he would keep an eye on Tice’s whereabouts. By the time Leach returned to the set, Landis’s inner circle had developed a new protocol.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Hilary Leach, the Directors’ Guild of America trainee, whose job included escorting the children on the set, was told by House to refer to My-Ca and Renee on her walkie-talkie only as “the Vietnamese,” just in case any of the fire safety officers overheard the radio transmissions. (35)</p>
      </div>
      <p>Dr. Le, Myca, Mrs. Chen, and Renee were picked up by the same white van and arrived back on set by about 7:40pm.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>NTSB: When you arrived, did anybody talk to you?</p>
         <p>SC: No.</p>
         <p>NSTB: When was the first time anybody talked to you or the children, that evening?</p>
         <p>SC: The heavy-set lady with the walkie-talkie talked to us.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Berchin) I believe her name is Hilary Leach.</p>
         <p>NTSB: She was the trainee director?</p>
         <p>(Mr. Berchin) Correct.</p>
         <p>NTSB: What did she say to you?</p>
         <p>SC: She say the children should go to make-up and change their clothes.</p>

      <h4>9:30pm</h4>

         <figcaption>2 of 3 camera angles recovered from the 9:30pm shot, at which time Marshall was present and, according to Chain, so was Kennedy (Chain Ch. 47).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Wooten recalled seeing the children in the “9:30 rescue sequence, assuming they were “pretty much put in at the last minute and taken out right away.”</p>
      <p>The helicopter hovered at approximately 60-feet overhead, well above the frame, generating propwash for the scene below. As well, the Production Manager (Allingham) was using it as a platform for the “Nite-Sun” spotlight the production had rented for the segment. He was aiming it out the pilot’s side window (the pilot was flying from the passenger side so that he could keep watch on the nearby cliff face), struggling to keep Morrow centered and in focus.</p>
      <p>Morrow approaches Renee and Myca behind a hut—where they’d been placed in wait next to two armed battery-wired explosives—scooped them one under each arm, and then runs out of frame just before the explosions go off.</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>[[Review Liddle testimony Herrick. Chain Ch. 20:</p>
        <p>On the fatal night the stand-in witnessed another incident that disturbed him. It occurred during a brief rehearsal just prior to the 9:30 rescue sequence. Liddle watched Vic Morrow grab the kids and, in a short run-by, drop Myca into the water. The little boy got wet and cried. Andy House saw it, too. Later, during the actual shot, Liddle felt that the kids were “shocked at all the noise and stuff.”</p>
        <p>In fact, because of Myca’s fall in the earlier run-by, Liddle and House assisted during the actual take a few minutes later: at the water’s edge Liddle stood to the actor’s left, Andy House stood to the right of Vic, and they took the kids from Vic’s arms as he ran out of the frame in the 9:30 take. Liddle briefly held Renee who was crying from sand that had blown in her eye from the propwash before handing her to one of the “[Asian]” people on the shore.</p>
        <p>After the take Andy House went up to Elie Cohn to express the fear that if Vic stumbled in the big exploding village shot later that evening the kids might drown. Cohn assured him that he had already talked to Vic about it – “no problem.” [See Herrick for Liddell NTSB]]]</p>
      </div>

      <p>When Landis was questioned on cross-examination by D’Agostino as to whether he had taken any safety precautions before the stumble, Landis provided as support, his having asked the children whether they could swim, presumably after this, the 9:30pm shot.</p>

      <div class="blockquote largequote">
         <p>Landis: Yes, I asked if the children could swim. One could and one could not.</p>
         <p>D.A.: Why did you need to know at 9:30 if the children could swim?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="emphasized-text">
         <p>But it was a heated moment, and she was in the middle of pursuing another point and failed to return to this critical detail.</p>
         <p>If Landis knew one of the children couldn’t swim, because he had been warned about the possibility of drowning, why did he proceed with the shot, after Landis had already seen Vic drop each child once, by accident, into the water (first Myca, then Renee, as witnessed by House and Liddell?)</p>
      </div>
      <p>100-feet away, across the water, Shyan Chen was startled; her and Dr. Le were standing, with Folsey between them, as they watched two fireballs roll up the face of the cliff. She turned to ask Folsey whether the scene was dangerous. She’d asked him already, earlier that day, on the phone. Folsey had told her husband something about “loud noises,” and “fireworks,” and he had assured her that there was no reason to be concerned, just to bring a change of clothes. The production would have heaters, blankets, and plenty of food and drinks, there would be a warm place for them to rest, and Folsey himself would be there, with his own family, and so would Landis, etc. He would pick them up with the driver in the van on the way to the location.</p>
      <div class="bold-text">
         <p>[“As they entered the gates of the park, George Folsey turned to Dr. Le. He was relieved to be on private property, Folsey said. The county officials would not be able to get in.” (F&G 118; and ?)]</p>
      </div>
      <p>The three of them had also been standing together, watching the first shot of the evening, taken from two redundant angles. It was a much closer shot of Morrow approaching Renee and Myca behind a hut—where they’d been waiting in proximity to two armed, hair-trigger, battery-wired explosives—scooping them up, and then running out of frame just before the explosions went off. The helicopter hovered 60ft overhead, generating propwash for effect.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>NTSB. There was one explosion during this period of time. Where was the helicopter?</p>
         <p>SC. Here.</p>
         <p>NTSB. Over this area, so the helicopter was—</p>
         <p>SC. Just right on top of the hut.</p>
         <p>NTSB. On top of the number 4 hut. Now, one explosion only. Did that surprise you?</p>
         <p>SC. Yes.</p>
         <p>NTSB. Excuse me, Mr. Chen. Off the record for a moment—were you surprised, Mrs. Chen, when an explosion went off?</p>
         <p>SC. I'm very surprised, because it's too noisy—</p>
         <p>NTSB. Too noisy and your eardrums hurt?</p>
         <p>SC. And the sand.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Chen) The sand was all over.</p>
         <p>(Mrs. Chen) Yeah, my eyes.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Chen) She was scared.</p>
         <p>(Mrs. Chen) Scared, very scared. Then I saw my daughter was crying.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Chen) Renee was crying at that moment.</p>
         <p>(Mrs. Chen) Renee had sand in her eyes.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Chen) John Landis went over and picked up Renee and held Renee in his arms.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Berchin) Because she was crying.</p>
         <p>NTSB. Okay. So Mr. Landis, after your daughter was crying, picked her up, calmed her down, and—</p>
         <p>SC. Came to me.</p>
         <p>NTSB. And then came to you? What did he tell you?</p>
         <p>SC. He didn't say anything. (Peter Chen) Mrs. Chen was asking Renee to come over to her side, and then she asked Renee whether she was afraid.</p>
         <p>Renee said yes, she was very scared. Renee's clothes were wet.</p>
         <p>So Mrs. Chen was afraid Renee might catch a cold, so she took Renee to have her clothes changed.</p>
         <p>Then Mrs. Chen asked a lady with the pair of glasses whether the filming was all over, and the lady said she did not know.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Then she asked Mrs. Chen and Renee to go inside of the trailer and rest there.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>NTSB. Did you complain to Mr. Landis or anyone about the first explosion, the first time you heard it?</p>
         <p>SC. Yeah, I just told George Folsey. He just said no, not dangerous. Everything's okay.</p>
         <p>(Peter Chen) Mrs. Chen says that she did ask George Folsey whether it was going to be dangerous, and George told her that no, it's going to be noisy, but not dangerous.</p>
         <p>(Mr. Berchin) Let the record reflect that when Mrs. Chen was explaining what Mr. Folsey said, that she put her right hand on her husband's shoulder, and I think that meant that Mr. Folsey touched her on the shoulder and said it's okay. There's no danger.</p>
      </div>
      <p>“At first Le had thought that the work was over after the nine-thirty shot and asked if he and his son could go home, but Folsey said, “It's not quite ready yet. We have some other things to do. You need to stay behind. We have some other things to do.” (LaBrecque 173)</p>
      <p>Shyan Chen NTSB interview:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>NTSB: After Renee went back into the trailer and changed clothes, did you go out and take another shot, or what were the events after that?</p>
         <p>PC (translating for SC): By the time they changed Renee's clothes and put her back to sleep, it was about 10 o'clock. About midnight, the heavy-set lady with the walkie-talkie woke them up.</p>
         <p>NTSB: That would be Hilary Leach?</p>
         <p>PC: Hilary Leach, yes. It was break time, lunch break. So she asked Mrs. Chen and Renee whether they wanted to have anything to eat. She said no, we're fine. She left, and after a while, George Folsey came back.</p>
         <p>NTSB: What did he say?</p>
         <p>PC: George Folsey stopped to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Chen. Let me summarize what he said. If you are approached by a fireman, just mention that you are friends, you are here to help out. Don't mention anything about the money that's been paid. This was the major content of Mr. Folsey's conversation with them.</p>
         <p>NTSB: Now. You arrived at about 7:30.</p>
         <p>PC: Yes.</p>
         <p>NTSB: At about 9:30, you brought the children out -</p>
         <p>PC: After the first explosion -</p>
         <p>NTSB: And then brought them back to the trailer, changed their clothes, and put them to sleep in the trailer. You were awakened -</p>
         <p>PC: Awakened at about midnight.</p>
         <p>NTSB: That's where I want to go. Between the time you arrived and midnight, there was only one explosion?</p>
         <p>PC: Yes, according to her memory.</p>
         <p>NTSB: Peter Malone (Fire Marshall's Office): May I just ask one thing. How far away was the trailer from where the village was, approximately?</p>
         <p>MC: (Mark Chen) Can I answer that? It's more than a mile.</p>
         <p>NTSB: (Mr. Malone) Oh, is it that far away?</p>
         <p>MC: Right in front of the park.</p>
         <p>NTSB: (Mr. Licente) That's where Vic Morrow's trailer was at?</p>
         <p>MC: Vic Morrow, actually, even Vic Morrow's trailer is very close by the scene, but ours is far down, by the entrance. You can see the old houses. That's why we didn't know what was going on. [We] were all in the trailer.</p>

      <p>Le Family: </p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Dr. Le: So, she took children to the trailer next door to get dressed and make up again. They put the old clothes, that were wet, so they put those clothes on. Then they took us by the Jeep to the set, straight to the set. And then I was standing there with George Folsey and a lot of people right at the set to see they get ready for the shooting. And then Rene’s mother, at that moment she was a little bit scary. She was standing near to me.

         <p>NTSB: At one o’clock was going to be the accident flight?</p>
         <p>Dr. Le: Yes.</p>
         <p>NTSB: Between the time of the accident flight and the last time the children were in the hut, how many times did you see the helicopter?</p>
         <p>Dr. Le: She said she saw the helicopter was over the hut once.</p>
         <p>NTSB: And that was at the 9:30?</p>
         <p>Dr. Le: Yes.</p>
         <p>NTSB. At 9:30 you went to the trailer, afterward?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Daniel Le and Shyan Chen both reported, respectively, that Folsey was directly asked twice about potential danger, both after the 9:30pm shot and before the 2:20am shot. Even after turning during the considerable pyrotechnics of the 11:30pm and saying he was glad his wife and children didn’t come, when asked, he minimized the danger to the same extent as he had up until that point time and time again.</p>

      <p>Shortly before 2:20am, a director’s guild trainee, Hilary Leach, led the kids from the makeup trailer to the village where Landis gave them and Morrow final remarks. He then returned to his spot near Cameras C & F as the helicopter took flight. Standing with him were the first AD (assistant director) Elie Cohn; Jerry Williams; and the propman, Mike Milgrom.</p>
      <p>Milgrom had just finished his last official duty of the night by giving Renee the “broken and naked barbie doll” prop, and had been recruited by Paul Stewart and Williams to fire a powerful marble gun along Morrow’s path to simulate the strafing. He wasn’t the only crew member moonlighting in a different role: one of the SFX truck drivers was also firing a marble gun, the Unit Production Manager, Dan Allingham, was trying to manage the Nite-Sun from outside the left-side helicopter window, and the Stunt Coordinator, Gary McLarty, who was also Vic Morrow’s stunt double, was firing one of the machine guns full of blanks from the helicopter. </p>
      <p>Williams had wrapped himself in a blanket as protection from the sheets of dust that had stung his eyes during the previous shot at 11:30pm. Camomile, standing downriver, was wearing a welder’s mask. He was standing with Paul Stewart, whose role in the shot was to cue Camomile when it was his turn to fire, and to radio Harry Stewart, further downriver for his part of the cue, two very large mortars near the dam.</p>
      <p>Standing further behind Landis was Production Designer Richard Sawyer. He was proud of the set he’d built. Earlier in the night, “one of the biggest producers in Hollywood” had put his arm around him and welcomed him to the big time (Cursed Films, S01E05). He’d just rebuilt the set, following the disarray of the 11:30pm shot, and lacquered their thatched roofs with liquid cement used as “fire fuel.”</p>
      <p>After being informed of the helicopter’s frightening near miss, around 12:30am or 1:00am Landis led a small group of technicians (1st AD, 2nd AD, DP, Paul Stewart (SFX Coordinator), Jerry Williams (SFX), James Camomile (SFX)) with waders through the village shoreline, which included 4 closed-air huts, 1 open-air “fishing hut,” and 1 wooden “sampan” boat attached to a long flimsy dock. Somehow two IEDs, one “round” (blasting outwards), and one “square” (blasting upwards) were placed close together, one on the shore (the square), and one under the wooden floor of the fishing hut.</p>
      <div class="bold-text">
         <p>This is significant because the helicopter pilot directly warned both the director and the Special Effects Coordinator, that there must be no debris whatsoever under his rotors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold-text emphasized-text">
         <p>While the trial was ongoing, the pilot had a civil lawsuit pending naming the director, Landis, for negligence. The DA’s office had many opportunities to leverage this conflict of interests but declined to do so (See Chain).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold-text">
         <p>[PHOTO]When questioned specifically about the small hut in the center of the village, which is tilted and was just east of the sampan, under which a mortar was found by investigators, he stated that, “This really was not a hut, it was just a four legged thing with a cheap thatched roof.”</p>

      <p>14 “mortars”—iron pots filled with gunpowder, gasoline, and sawdust—had been dug into the ground. The plan was that once Morrow and the kids were about 15ft away from the village, three members of the SFX team, Jerry Williams, James Camomile, and Harry Stewart would begin triggering their respectively assigned series of mortars. They were all operating under SFX coordinator Paul Stewart (no relation).</p>

      <p>The scene was filmed by 6 cameras. Two cameras (A & B) were across from the village, about 100ft away: one getting close-ups from the water below, and the other getting the master shot from the platform of a Chapman crane. The entire reason Landis wanted to use real children for this shot rather than dummies or little people was for the sake of the realism of the Camera A close-up.</p>

It was a carefully framed shot and Landis gave himself a backup by having the Director of Photography, Steve Larner, shoot a redundant angle (F). </p>

      <p>The Bell UH-1 Iroquois ‘Huey’ hovered in place at just 24 feet overhead, tracking them with its spotlight as Morrow ran. A series of massive explosions were being detonated behind him. A fourth major explosion propelled a fireball up through the bamboo floor of a fish-drying hut, destroying the tail rotor of the helicopter and sending it into an uncontrolled spiral, just as the entire village began to thunder from a fresh, climactic round of background pyrotechnic blasts. Morrow had stumbled to his knees and was struggling to hold onto Renee, who had just fallen out of his hands and into the water below.</p>
      <p>Landis would later testify that this <a href="#bookmark=id.ef9kuyxjwfs">stumble</a> was something, unscripted, he had devised with Morrow just minutes before calling action on the final scene! If his own testimony is to be believed, then, given the geometric relationship between the spotlight, the helicopter at 24-feet, and the runway path of Vic and the kids (given their <a href="#bookmark=id.ppbuwcjwrslm">starting position</a>, which is uncertain), wasn’t the decision to yoke the spotlight to Vic and the kids, essentially creating a deathtrap, where the helicopter would necessarily end up exactly where it did, with its tail rotor under the shoreline “fishing hut,” and a series of IEDs going off in sequence crossing through the village shoreline, with others—big ones—causing shockwaves, going off deep in the background of the profile shot (Cameras C and F). </p>

      <p>Ultimately, this was blamed on the poor judgement of special effects technician James Camomile—one of three each in charge of firing their own series of IEDs (with the exact series’ fired by which technicians being <a href="#bookmark=id.hom4gg85u1zy">a matter of deep confusion</a>)—who failed to look up to check the position of the helicopter before firing the fatal charge, because he was watching (through a welder’s mask) to make sure the children were out of harm’s way of the explosives. The various technical cues established during the 9:30pm, 11:30pm, and <a href="#bookmark=id.ilev7u3k7kcy">2:00am lighting rehearsal</a> are <a href="#bookmark=id.hom4gg85u1zy">controversial</a>, but one was believed to be <a href="#bookmark=id.hom4gg85u1zy">a eucalyptus (“eukie”) stick</a>, placed approximately 50-meters (halfway) into the manmade lake.</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="accordion-content">

      <p>California Penal Code...  Homicide...  Manslaughter... </p>
      <p>... §192. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It is of three kinds:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>(a) Voluntary—upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</p>
         <p>(b) Involuntary—in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection. This subdivision shall not apply to acts committed in the driving of a vehicle.</p>
         <p>(c) Vehicular... [prosecuted as a distinct category, owing to its nuances].</p>
      </div>

      <p>Landis and his underlings conceded that they had hired the children illegally (the unlawful act) but not that their actions met the standard of “gross negligence.”</p>
      <p>The charge of involuntary manslaughter, in addition to addressing a physical dimension (like, e.g., battery) necessarily operates in a realm of hazy agency and responsibility. Ironically, one judge termed it a “twilight zone which exists somewhere between ordinary negligence and intentional injury.” 10. Pleasant v. Johnson, 325 S.E.2d 244, 247 (N.C. 1985)).</p>
      <p>The state concedes that although the defendant(s) didn’t intend the harm done, their actions were still of a criminal character. This is because, if the substantial risk of harm was foreseeable (when measured against the actions of a hypothetical reasonable person acting in their place), and yet the defendant(s) proceeded anyway, they either noticed the danger and behaved extremely recklessly in disregarding it, or, if they didn’t notice the danger, should have, if not for their own prior act of willful ignorance, or carelessness.</p>

      <h4>One of two audio recordings</h4>

      <p>The lone recovered audio recording (the one without the voices) was used as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HuW3X4yBRQTXuJA5sle0hlealV94Zxfw/view?usp=share_link">evidence</a> in the preliminary hearing.</p>
      <p>Two separate audio teams were hired to record the sound for the 2:20am shot. In the chaotic aftermath of the accident, for several days, the footage and sound recordings were withheld by the studio. One of the audio recordings had gone missing. This was of particular significance because, at that time in the case, whether or not Landis was the one to call the helicopter “Lower! Lower! Lower!” and “Fire!” “Fire! Fire!” (or “Closer, Closer, Closer”) through a bullhorn, was a major controversy. </p>
      <p>It was soon overwhelmingly settled, however, that it was indeed Landis who had been standing, warning the crowd to get on their feet in case anything happened, then positioning the helicopter, until it was hovering above the children, 24-feet up to its skids, at a slight angle, blasting a spotlight down at them (the numerically same one used in <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span>, incidentally).</p>

Mr. Renard stated that he was employed as a Photographer to take still publicity photographs of the “Twilight Zone” movie. Mr. Renard stated that he had taken approximately 108 photographs. Following the fatal crash, Mr. Renard took his three rolls of film with 36 photographs each, to Mr. Robert Friedman, Director of Publicity for Warner Brothers. He stated that he personally handed these three rolls of film to Mr. Friedman.</p>
      <p>On 3-10-86, Sergeant Budds telephoned MR. ROBERT FRIEDMAN at Warner Brothers Studios. Mr. Friedman stated that he will try and locate the above photographs. As of the writing of this report, the photographs had not been located.”</p>
      <p>However, a batch of several from July 21st (most likely) AND/OR July 22nd at Ron LaBrecque Archive in Beverly Hills, in which Marshall appears in waders, along with a handful of other upper level production members (Landis, Larner, Folsey among them).</p>

      <h4>Several “thumbnail sketches” </h4>

      <p>July 28th, 1982—five days after the accident:</p>
      <p>When Landis was asked by Cal/OSHA during a stressful and consequential panel interview with the NTSB. Chain gives two different quotations of Landis, significant because at the time, Landis’s testimony was being actively edited in real-time by his attorney (as reported-on by Chain in 2022) with 108 interruptions on his client’s testimony.</p>
      <p>“He was asked whether there were any written plans for the sequence with the helicopter flying and the explosions going off. Cavalierly, the director allowed, “There were lots of thumbnail sketches.” As for blueprints, he couldn’t remember.” (Ch. 16)</p>
      <p>“The movie director had already told the NTSB panel that he couldn’t remember any blueprints showing the planned final scene, mentioning only to the investigators that he remembered a “few thumbnail sketches.” (Ch. 26)</p>

      <h4>all graphic and visual materials relating to the film’s production,</h4>

      <p>With the additional $200,000 budget, especially such a technically involved shot, the scene would certainly need to be planned out in some respect, and indeed designers were hired for the task.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Richard Sawyer Gregory Pickrell Tom Stopwell (whose garage they worked in).</p>
         <p>“By the set designer’s account, Williams’ haphazard procedure showed an unusual departure from conventional film-making practices. Ordinarily, the SFX crew would work from a diagram called the “plot plan.” In fact, in the days just before the final night’s shooting, Stewart had dispatched his crew to the location with a backhoe tractor to make the holes that were to house the exploding mortars. Sawyer remembered giving Stewart a bare drawing of the village which he assumed Stewart would use as a blueprint to map out the planned locations of the explosives on the set. Director of photography Steve Larner, too, remembered seeing such a blueprint. Typically, however, like most of the artists’ renderings and visual representations of the set that night – sketches, drawings, blueprints, notes – a special effects plot plan for the fatal scene was never found.”</p>
      </div>

      <h4>“the spotting plan”</h4>
      <p>September 16th, 1982—until ordered to do so by a federal judge.</p>
      <p>RICHARD TOM SAWYER (GRAND JURY TESTIMONY; SUMMARY BY COURT STENOGRAPHER)</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Hired Greg Pickerell to do some artists renditions of village—his job is a set designer who lays out the plans of the sets. Says he had a four week prep to do the show. Got sketch in June. It shows a downed helicopter, a crashed helicopter in about position it really happened, without rear rotor. To clarify, kesselman asks him questions about Landis— he says Landis never said he wanted downed helicopter in sketches and never mentioned that there would be be crashed helicopter at Indian Dunes.</p>
         <p>Pickerel knew of helicopter in basement of paramount and he said “gee, you know it would be a great idea, since we are showing a village under attack, why don’t we have a helicopter in the water?”</p>
         <p>Sawyer says he told pickerel that he didn’t think it would work but to finish drawings and they would get back to him.</p>
         <p>Pickerell said it was a result of his own research that he put helicopter that way.</p>
         <p>Interviewer: As far as you know this is strictly an ungodly coincidence?”</p>
      </div>
      <p>Budds had been puzzled by the image.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>This “artist’s concept” of the last scene of the Landis episode had been drawn several weeks prior to any filming. This graphic drawing depicted the Vietnamese village with a crashed helicopter (tail missing) and was located approximately 20 feet from the actual crash position. Investigation buddy took this graphic drawing to the Sheriff’s Photo Lab where it was photographed.</p>
         <p>“Gregory Pickrell,  </p>
         <p>Mr Pickerel stated that he was one of the artists for the Landis episode of <span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span>. He stated he was the individual who had drawn the graphic which depicted the crashed helicopter in the final scene of the Landis episode.</p>
         <p>He stated that he put a crashed helicopter into this artist’s conception because following his research about Vietnamese villages he thought it would add authenticity. He concluded that this concept was solely his idea and that he had suggested to his boss Richard Sawyer that a crashed helicopter be considered for this scene but he had not heard any more about it.” (Police Report)</p>

      <p>The Chen lawsuit, seeking $200-million dollars in damages, was filed on August 3rd, 1982, within two weeks of the accident. In the initial confusion, it named a broad swath of defendants (LaBrecque 68; Farber and Green 177).

      <h4>1. August 1982: Legal Brief viz. Chen family lawsuit</h4>

      <p>Sometime after the Chen family filed their civil suit (August 2nd, 1982), Spielberg’s lawyers filed a brief stating:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Spielberg is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at the time and place of the events complained of, plaintiffs and each of them were not exercising ordinary care, caution or prudence to prevent the injuries sustained by them or by decedent and that, therefore, the injuries alleged were proximately caused by the negligence or comparative negligence of the plaintiffs.” (“Warners: Child <span class="movietitle">Twilight</span> Victim 'Assumed the Risk,'” LAHE, May 13, 1983.)</p>
      </div>

      <p>The media reported on Warner Bros shockingly callous response to the Chen filing:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>That if the plaintiffs suffered or sustained any loss, damage orinjury...  the risk, if any risk there was, was knowingly assumed by the decedent, Renee Shin-Yi Chen.</p>
      </div>

      <p>But not to the fact that the Co-Producer, Spielberg’s, response said substantially the same thing.</p>
      
      <h4>2. December 1st, 1982: Signed Affidavit to the NTSB</h4>

      <p>On November 5th, the 10-ton special effects union truck driver, Carl Pittman, told the NTSB and the Sheriff’s department in sworn testimony (per Pittman’s request) that he’d seen Spielberg at the scene the night of the accident.</p>
      <p>Budds’ report states that:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>MR. PITTMAN STATED THAT FOLLOWING THE CRASH SCENE, he had assisted Mr. Landis and one of the childrens’ parents in obtaining a vehicle to leave the set, and likewise, had secured a vehicle for STEVEN SPIELBERG to leave the set.</p>
         <p>“Mr. Spielberg requested a car, so I got him a car—he needed to go to the phone, and I was mad enough at him that I had to walk away from him.” When asked by the investigators what caused him to say he was “mad” at Spielberg, Pittman replied, “He was too cold about it. ... In fact, I didn't want him to have the car; I wanted to keep it there in case anyone else [needed the car]—at this point, no one knew how many people were injured.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>But Pittman’s claim was dubious at best. He’d admitted that he’d been drinking since 4:00pm the night of the accident; none of the other 31 on-set witnesses interviewed corroborated the sighting; and in general the special effects crew were suspicious, since they were potentially liable for the accident and had varying, contradictory stories. Pittman also admitted to investigators, the morning of the accident, that he’d bought about $150 worth of drinks for the special effects crew. After the accident, the seven or eight of them packed up their gear within 10 minutes, and Pittman drove the 10-ton special effects truck back to the Warner Bros lot, followed by another special-effects driver (Theldynamos “Ted” Triantafellow) in a pickup truck, where they were both offloaded and wiped clean.</p>
      <p>Pittman soon admitted he did not know Spielberg and probably had him confused with Frank Marshall, the film's executive producer. Still, the NTSB reached out to Spielberg to ask whether he had any information pertinent to the crash (Farber and Green 186).</p>
      <p>Spielberg produced a signed affidavit: </p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>In response to your request, I was never at the Indian Dunes location of <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> on the night of the accident or at any other time. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, executed at Los Angeles, California, this first day of December, 1982.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>3. April 13th, 1983. “Spielberg Philosophical Over <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> Defeat,”</h4>

      <p>The day after the 1983 Oscars, an interview was printed in the Los Angeles Times with reporter Dale Pollock, “Spielberg Philosophical Over <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> Defeat,” in which the filmmaker finally addressed the accident publicly, or at least in print:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>“This has been the most interesting year of my film career...  It has mixed the best, the success of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, with the worst, the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> tragedy. A mixture of ecstasy and grief. It's made me grow up a little more. The accident cast a pall on all 150 people who worked on this production. We are still just sick to the centre of our souls. I don't know anybody who it hasn't affected.</p>
         <p>A movie is a fantasy—it's light and shadow flickering on a screen. No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now than ever before to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn't safe, it's the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, 'Cut!'”[^2]</p>
      </div>

      <p>But its timing and cadence gave it the air of a press release.</p>
      
      <h4>4. May 21st, 1984: “Spielberg Gets Place to Settle Down,”</h4>
      
      <p>In April 1984, two days before Temple of Doom was released, Pollock wrote a second article about the case, reporting that although Spielberg and Landis remained close friends, “the experience is still clearly painful.”[^3]</p>
      <p>Only a single quote from Spielberg was printed:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>It was tough on all of us, all 390 people involved in making the movie, and it continues to be.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The number of persons Spielberg counted as “making the movie” had risen from 150 to 390, establishing that he was speaking for the production as a whole, and not just those involved in making the Landis segment (LaBrecque 129), as though it were an amendment rather than a new statement.</p>
      <p>Spielberg never addressed the accident again.</p>
      <p>In 1985, at the end of an interview for The Color Purple, CNN reporter Sandy Kenyon asked Spielberg for a comment on the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> case. Spielberg reportedly “began screaming and waving his arms, demanding that the cameras be turned off at once” (Farber and Green 160).</p>
      
      <h4>5. Marshall and Kennedy</h4>
      
      <p>Marshall and Kennedy never spoke with authorities or on the record, except for Marshall’s 1990 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-18-ca-714-story.html">interview</a> with the L.A. Times in which he failed spectacularly to downplay his involvement. Vane declined to cooperate with the investigation, but did testify at the 1983 grand jury hearing, supplying Marshall an alibi by testifying that during the final shot Marshall conveyed that he believed dummies were going to be used, which helped firewall the rest of the production personnel from the Landis group.</p>
      
      <h4>04. “Twilight Zone—Landis Episode”] Pre-Production (January-March 1982).</h4>

      <p>[“<span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span> has always meant, more than anything else, those little musical notes that you hear from the other room—like a bugle call that draws you to the television set and grips you for half an hour.” (Spielberg qtd. in F&G 63)]]</p>
      <p>Co-Producer Steven Spielberg—along with Executive Producer Frank Marshall, Warner Brothers President of Creative, Lucy Fisher, and Warner Brothers President of Production, Terry Semel—was sent Landis’ initial draft and each of its three revisions (James Neal, opening statements). Spielberg’s input would have been highly valued. As of June 11th, 1982, <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>, <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> had all been released within the previous calendar year. Owing to his success with these films, Warner Brothers had a fiduciary obligation to solicit Spielberg’s professional opinion. As well, not only Warner Brothers, but Amblin, and Spielberg and Marshall specifically, were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Q1-LOr53x-Cwikgf6F3p5GTxPfC5TqheWpH7qLo1ZI4/edit">literally invested</a> in <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>’s box office success. In a more practical sense, Spielberg, as co-producer, would need to know what was going on in the other segments. This would enable him to manage overall themes and plan the sequence of the segments, including transitions between them. Joe Dante, the director of the third segment, “It’s a Good Life,” said that originally the concept was that “all the stories were going to connect.”</p>

      <div class="blockquote largequote">
         <p>“Originally the concept was that characters from one episode would appear in another, so that it wasn't just a series of free-standing stories. It was all linked together. So it seemed like it was a long piece.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>In fact, the first revision of Landis’ script (May 24th) ends with the lines:</p>

      <div class="scriptexcerpt">
         <div class="scriptexcerpt-left">
            <p>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
            <p>Ray smiles, and he and Larry help Bill walk to his car as the CAMERA pans up to see a 747 roar across the sky.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. 747 - DAY</p>
            <p>TO BE CONTINUED BY MR. MATHESON</p>
         </div>
      </div>

      <p>“Matheson” is Richard Matheson, the writer of the other three segments. This version punctuates the transition to another segment, “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” which takes place on a 747. This indicates that Landis’ revisions were at least inclusive of broader production conversations concerning the movie as a whole, which would have necessarily involved Spielberg.</p>
      <p>According to George Miller’s account of being added to the movie in late May ‘82, the movie was a going concern for Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy. “They were having a meeting to discuss <span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span>. I remember Steven was there, Kathy Kennedy, and a few others, and they invited me to sit down. Up to that time, it had been planned to do three stories [not including the prologue], and now they'd decided to do a fourth. 'Why don't you do one?' someone said. I wasn't sure they weren't having me on at the time.”</p>
      <p>According to Joe Dante, prior to the accident the movie was conceived as a mixture of old and new stories.</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>There was a lot of talk about [remaking] old episodes,” Dante recently recalled. “I didn't really want to do an old episode—I thought there [were] so many great stories that hadn't been done on <span class="movietitle">The Twilight Zone</span> that you could do four new stories. But I think that for whatever reason the studio insisted on doing remakes. [...] Steven's first thought was to remake “It's a Good Life,” about the little kid with truly awful powers[... ] That's the segment I ultimately inherited. (Cinefex #14)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Dante explained further how the conceit of the movie would work: </p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>When Steve was still planning to do his Halloween story, there was a big chase at the end, which would have linked up to mine when the camera suddenly pulled back and you saw that the chase was actually part of a video game being played by the kid at the beginning of my story. I think the Kathleen Quinlan character in my episode lost something when it was decided to put George’s episode after mine. Originally, the ambulance taking John Lithgow away from the plane goes past the hospital, just as Kathleen is leaving with a friend. Her mother has just died, and she is giving up teaching. All she wants to do is go out in the world and learn things.</p>
      </div>

      <p>George Miller, the fourth director to be added, would remake the classic '60s episode Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, another segment which Spielberg wanted to see in the movie. Spielberg and Landis were going to direct the originals.</p>
      <p>Besides the prologue and Landis’ segment, all three were going to be written by Richard Matheson, a prolific original <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> screenwriter, who also wrote Spielberg’s hit TV movie Duel (1971) about a giant semi-truck that terrorizes an anxious, deferential man. Spielberg was working closely with him on an original segment about a neighborhood bully who on Halloween becomes prey to supernatural forces.</p>
      <p>Spielberg himself described it as follows: </p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Basically, this is a neighborhood bully, whose costume happens to be the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Trick or treat isn’t enough for him – he runs amok across the streets on Halloween, egging houses, leaving burning bags of dog manure on the front porch; stealing bags from other kids; and single-handedly ruining the holiday for everyone he can – enjoying every minute of his mischief. That is, until...  a few strange things commence to happen. It’s been years since I read the script, but I remember a postbox lurching at him; I remember a little girl in a witch’s costume suddenly growing into an ugly, full-sized witch lurching out to seize him. I remember the streets full of ‘REAL’ werewolves and patched-together Frankenstein Monsters and vampires, all stalking him in earnest. I remember a doorknob attempting to BITE his hand when he tries to take refuge in his own house. And ultimately, I remember that when he thinks he is safe in his own home, safe at last from the unexpected horrors which have transformed his neighborhood into a living hell, he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the hall mirror, and he sees Quasimodo – the real thing. His simple makeup and costume are gone. He IS Quasimodo! Horrified, he runs out of the house in total disorientation, and the monsters catch sight of him, and we last see them in close pursuit as he stumbles on his twisted legs across a large vacant lot with the huge October moon in the sky beyond. (<span class="booktitle">Twilight Zone Magazine</span> 1983)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Matheson summarized it as “a bully who's mistreating all these young trick-or-treating kids, and the supernatural world gets him for it. Creatures—real live monsters—start chasing him around.” And then the mask becomes fused to his face. According to McBride, it was based on a feature Spielberg had been developing for MGM (343). </p>
      <p>Work on the Spielberg-Matheson project proceeded well into the summer of 1982. During an interview for Starlog magazine, which focused on the by-then phenomenal success of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, Spielberg said of his <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> segment, “[W]e have all these monsters we have to build” (Starlog #62, cf. McBride 342). The creature effects were going to be done by Craig Reardon, who did the effects for Landis’ prologue, ‘Real Scary’, as well as ‘It’s A Good Life’, and ‘Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.’</p>

      </figure>

      <p>In order, then, it was going to go ‘Bigot’; ‘Hunchback’; ‘Nightmare’; ‘It’s a Good Life.’ And then at some point before the accident, according to McBride, Spielberg decided he would remake ‘The Monsters are Due on Maple Street.’ After the accident, he changed his sequence again, to another classic episode, ‘Kick the Can.’ All four of the segments in the finished movie include the loose unifyer of being about characters caught in schizoid states.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Landis had intended a powerful message: “In ‘Time Out’ I wanted to be true to the spirit of the old TZ show and to inject a lot of Serling's own politics and morality into that episode... It's the only political or moral episode in the film, actually (<span class="booktitle">Twilight Zone Magazine</span> Oct. 1983).” The logic of his story placed the United States' participation in the Vietnam War within a continuum of the most morally perverse political projects of the 20th century, including the KKK, Nazism, and, depending on what Landis would have evoked visually in the climactic shots, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, without the structural corrections made in the 3rd and 4th drafts, it failed to achieve the intended emotional impact.</p>

         <figcaption>Bill’s companions in the car. The version of the movie released in theaters on June 24th, 1983, reverted back to the original draft, in which Bill sees his friends exit the bar, before the freight train he’s been thrown into pulls away for the death camps.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Bill’s dialogue in the bar scene is more significant than it seems. We learn that he has been working at his job for 17 years (since 1966 or 1967); that the promotion he lost is going to cost him $6,000/year, and that he was “counting on it”; that his house is owned by a Japanese bank; that he was “in the war” and “paid to kill [Asians]”; and that he has to go home early to meet his in-laws. We have the sketch of a man using racism as a way of blaming everyone else for his misfortunes, culminating, it seems, in the imminent threat of losing his house to a bank owned by the same “Asians” (in Bill’s calculation) that America, back in “the war,” neglected to exterminate completely. He faults the Jews—clever and greedy—for his career setbacks, and resents being thought of as belonging to the same social basement as blacks—i.e., the lowly working class. Over the course of his journey, Morrow experiences what it really means to be victimized by a powerful other, showing his complaints to be a screen for continued aggression. However, by the end of the story, once it reaches its ‘root’ in his Vietnam reversal, we sense that Bill’s racism and the personal failures it masks are a coping mechanism for guilt he feels over what he did in the war and what it implies about him as a person and the state that paid him. But what exactly Bill did is ambiguous. Did he fail to save two children, out of cowardice? Was he part of the 1st Cavalry Division, associated with the firebombing villages and shooting at villagers indiscriminately? Or is the transmission intentionally general? Was it the Battle of La Deng (1965)?</p>
      <p>The 3rd draft, which introduces the village segment and the two children, brings Landis’ episode into line with the rest of the segments. Spielberg, famously, of course, often incorporates children into his work.</p>
      <p id="bookmark=id.wmsay4uezx1q">But a change in the 4th draft (6/26/82), the two-line addition of a “MacGuffin” (in storytelling terms, an emotionally-charged object of desire) is even more peculiar.</p>

      <div class="scriptexcerpt">
         <div class="scriptexcerpt-left">
            <p>The little Girl hands Bill a broken and naked Barbie Doll. </p>
            <p>Bill (genuinely touched), responds, “Thank you honey. Thank you very much.”</p>
         </div>
      </div>

      <p>This simple prop substantiates the emotional reversal established in the previous revision, giving the audience a clearer point of focus for the projection of their own petty grievances and allowing them to participate in Bill’s spiritual purification.</p>
      <p>The 3rd and 4th drafts both also successively tweak the ending. In the 3rd, he’s hit by a truck offscreen, just in time for his friends to see, and “pinned under the rear tire of a truck.” In the 4th revision, his friends call out to him but it’s too late, and he’s “clipped by a car in the street in front of the bar” and “thrown violently to the curb.”</p>
      
      <div class="scriptexcerpt">
         <div class="scriptexcerpt-left">

      </div>

      <p>The MacGuffin takes on a second significance, providing the evidence of a final twist—maybe it wasn’t a psychotic episode after all.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the 4th draft was never turned over to investigators. The only copy of the script they were given was the 3rd draft (June 13th, 1982—without the doll and other subtle amendments) (Chain 187; Budds’ 1982 supplementary report only cites the 3rd draft, ).</p>
      <p>Each of the three historical narratives follows Morrow as he flees the dominant social group in a life-threatening manhunt, until he’s finally seized by the police in the Nazi timeline. According to Allingham, the narrative function of the spotlight was to induce a fear of the “police state” in the film.</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>1941 timeline: “The beam falls on him, pinning him in its harsh spot-light.” (all versions.) </p>
         <p>1954/196? timeline transition: “A BLINDING LIGHT comes from the sky accompanied by tremendous winds and a deafening roar. Bill looks up in terror as a HUEY HELICOPTER descends on him.” (2nd Draft)</p>
         <p>196? timeline: “The helicopter turns on a powerful spotlight and hovers over the village sweeping it with its beam.” (3rd and 4th draft)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Is the implication that Bill’s journey was a near-death hallucination after stepping into harm’s way, in the moment before his friends got outside? In this vision, he is instantly cured. His delusions are countered by the reversal, and he is confronted by the emotional denial that is the source of his cycling depression and hyper-reactivity.</p>
      <p>There’s also another, hypothetical, ending, which Mrs. Le reported hearing from Folsey or Landis on July 16th during their children’s auditions, in which Vic is crossing from a Vietnamese camp to an American camp.</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>George Folsey Jr. told Mr. & Mrs. Le that they needed Vietnamese children for the movie; that the two children would be the last two (2) survivors left alone with actor Vic Morrow. Morrow was to pick up the two (2) children, and run across a stream or river to a shed for safety.</p>
         <div class="largequote">
            <p>A helicopter was to pick them up.</p>

         <p>Summary of August 2nd Interview with the Le family, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>[NTSB: During the time that you were there, from Wednesday, you said about 7, or so, until you left Thursday morning, did you ever see the helicopter fly over the area?</p>
         <p>MC: No.</p>
         <p>NTSB: Did you know who the pilot was? Could you identify the pilot now?</p>
         <p>MC: No, because we didn't know anything. We weren't being told.</p>
         <p>NTSB: So that evening, as far as you're concerned, you didn't see the helicopter?</p>
         <p>MC: We didn't see anything. What we'd been told is the actor would carry two children across the rivers. That's all. Because, oh, I remember, he said one side has American patrol, the other side has Vietnamese patrol, or whatever. So that's why the actor wanted to carry two children across to the American side.</p>
      </div>

      <p>But it’s even unclear exactly which version Landis was making, or whether he was revising it as he went. In the movie, for instance, there is no spotlight used in the Nazi-era ledge scene. In the fatal 2:20am footage on July 23rd, the Barbie doll can be identified in Renee’s hands in the final shot. Because of the accident, Landis and Warner Brothers decided not to include the added segment with the children; this effectively reverted Landis’ segment back to its pre-June 13th state.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Spielberg’s final segment, ‘Kick the Can’, follows a new resident, Mr. Bloom (Scatman Crothers) of Sunnyvale Retirement Home, The residents of the home are old and lifeless, particularly the crabby Mr. Conroy, who associates maturity with dour seriousness. Bloom rallies the residents to a moonlit game of kick the can, which magically grants their wishes of being restored to youth. Soon, however, they each, save one, decide that they can’t be bothered to do it all again, and embrace aging playfully instead.</p>
      <p>In the end, Mr. Conroy, tragically finds out that magic is real, but that his bitterness has caused him to miss the miracle of eternal youth.</p>

      <p>“It was a very emotional time for Steven,” Dante recalls. “Steven was very affected by the accident. Then he felt somewhat betrayed by it. He felt he couldn't understand what happened, and he suddenly became the brunt [of bad publicity]. I think he deeply resented it.”</p>
      <p>According to Farber and Green, “the director did not even attend the pre-production meeting on the segment. “His heart just wasn’t in it anymore,” says Patrick Kehoe, the first AD” (174).</p>
      <p>“It probably is accurate to say that Mr. Spielberg's heart wasn't in the movie after the accident,”stated Spielberg's then-secretary Kathy Switzer. “[A]t the time, I didn't know Mr. Spielberg well enough to make a judgment about how he felt emotionally. I do know it was a very sad time.”</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Spielberg was so busy preparing detailed sketches for <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>...  that he delegated some of his usual directing duties on <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>. ... he asked the script supervisor, Katherine Wooten, and his friend Melissa Mathison (the screenwriter of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> and the wife of Harrison Ford), who had written the final draft of ‘Kick the Can’ under a pseudonym, to block out the action with the performers and work with them on their line readings.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Like the Landis episode, however, ‘Kick the Can’ went through several revisions. After the accident prompted Spielberg to switch his Halloween segment to a remake of a particularly Frank Capra-esque episode from Season 3 of the original series ‘Kick the Can’ (1962).</p>
      <p>But first, in light of the accident, before agreeing to license his teleplay, the <a href="http://twilightzonevortex.blogspot.com/2017/02/kick-can.html">original writer</a> insisted on meeting with Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, “and gave them a short, three page outline which contained a new ending to his story. In light of the accident, Johnson felt that his original teleplay was “a bit irresponsible in that it failed to portray the reality of the situation. These kids were now on their own with no one to take care of them. The outline featured an additional sequence which began where the original story ended, with the kids running off into the woods. It follows the kids on their adventure through the woods, laughing and playing, lost in the exhilaration of youth. As the excitement fades they grow tired and hungry and scared. The consequences of their actions become a reality. They stumble upon the rest home, unfamiliar to them now, and climb into the warm beds where they are transformed back into their older selves.”</p>
      <p>It was adapted by Matheson, who removed the scenes in the woods. Then, Spielberg had it reworked by Melissa Mathison (working under the pseudonym Josh Rogan), who gave it a whimsical Midsummer Night’s Dream gloss.</p>

      <h3>5. A Newly Prolific Storyboarding Practice</h3>
      <p>McBride notes that in an effort to bring Raiders of the Lost Ark  “Working with four illustrators, Spielberg storyboarded it more fully than any of his previous films” (320ff.).</p>

      </figure>

      <p><span class="movietitle">Temple of Doom</span> (which began shooting April 1983) was even heavier on the storyboards. In an American Society of Cinematographers article going into great detail on Spielberg’s process for the film, he said: “Rather than bringing a script with me when I shoot a particular sequence, I work from storyboards. For <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>, I developed about 4,000 individual frames which were drawn by Ed Verreaux, Joe Johnston, and even Elliot Scott, our production designer out of England, who did some thumbnails and creative paintings himself.”</p>

            ... Kesselman stated to the press that an exhaustive investigation proved that only Landis, Folsey, and Allingham were guilty of a conspiracy to employ minors without permits. However, Kesselman never charged Landis, Folsey, or Allingham with this crime. Since your office decided not to charge the most obvious participants, it clearly chose not to investigate whether the agreement included others.</label></a></p>

            The failure of your office to even question Spielberg, Marshall, Kennedy, and others about the employment of minors without permits is consistent with the fact that this crime was never investigated. For your office to now say that it could not interview Spielberg or Marshall during the year between the accident and the indictment is so bizarre that it lacks any credibility whatsoever.</label></a></p>

            I believe that Kesselman did not question Spielberg, Marshall, or Kennedy not because he could not find them but because they would destroy his case against the other defendants. The issue involved in the “Twilight Zone” case as charged by your office is whether the defendants knew about a serious danger on the set and chose to disregard that danger. Simple interviews with Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy would reveal that these highly placed and acknowledged experts knew that a scene was being shot in their own movie in which actors were being used in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. These participants knew the elements of the scene and would have stopped the production had they ever thought that special effects could not be safely used with actors and helicopters. For Kesselman to have pursued the conspiracy to employ minors without a permit would have resulted in the destruction of his manslaughter case against the five targeted defendants.</label></a></p>

            <a><label for="redact-t04">
            Frank Marshall was on the set on the night of the accident as well as on the previous night. Marshall saw the children present and saw them in the 9:30 shot in which they were held by Vic Morrow in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. Marshall was present the whole evening and observed the 11:30 sequence involving Morrow, the 2:00 rehearsal as well as the scene in which the accident occurred. Marshall was the producer of the “Twilight Zone” and participated at meetings in which the hiring of the children was discussed and agreed upon. Since the statute of limitations has now expired, he has no fifth amendment right and if asked will hopefully tell the truth. But what must be emphasized again is the fact that his participation in the hiring of the children without permits was viewed as a “technical” violation that in no way meant that anyone was in danger.</label></a></p>
         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t05" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t05">
            Marshall and Kennedy could verify that Kennedy called the Department of Labor to determine whether permits could be obtained for minors after hours. It was only after her call received a negative response, that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Again, Ms. Kennedy had no belief that there was any danger even though she was intimately acquainted with the nature of the shot and the use of the children. In fact, she was on the set the prior night when the scenes filmed on the fatal night were scheduled to be shot.</label></a></p>
         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t06" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t06">
            With respect to Mr. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy will be able to state whether he knew that children were to be employed without permits. It could be reasonably inferred that given the close relationship between Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy and Spielberg’s close supervision of his own movies, that it would be almost inconceivable that Marshall and Kennedy would not tell Spielberg that children were to be employed without permits on Spielberg’s own movie.</label></a></p>

         <p>In addition, the letter that was obtained from Spielberg after the accident is interesting in that he only states that he was not on the set the night of the accident but nowhere addresses himself to the issue of whether he knew the children were employed without permits. Since that employment was an issue at the time the letter was written, one would assume that he could have denied his guilt simply by adding an additional line.</p>

            The unbelievable unavailability of Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy throughout the three and one half year investigation leads one to recall that old saying that "the guilty flee when no man pursueth, but the innocent are as bold as the lion."</label></a></p>

            Since your office has never charged anyone with the obvious conspiracy to employ minors without permits and the statute of limitations has now run, one might wonder whether there is any purpose in pursuing the matter. The relevance is that many knowledgeable people participated in this employment and none of these people thought that the planned scene posed a danger to the children. In short, the breadth of the participation destroys the credibility of the current charges.</label></a></p>

            You might wish to start your investigation by questioning Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy. You should follow this up by questioning all the executives at Warner Bros. who participated directly or indirectly with the "Twilight Zone" movie. Since the statute of limitations has run there is no need for Miranda rights or lawyers. You might wish to determine how a corporate check was generated to pay these children and who signed the check. You might wish to ask your own investigators why these simple interviews have not taken place in the three and one half years since the accident.</label></a></p>

         <p>... Frank Marshall was on the set on the night of the accident as well as on the previous night. Marshall saw the children present and saw them in the 9:30 shot in which they were held by Vic Morrow in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. Marshall was present the whole evening and observed the 11:30 sequence involving Morrow, the 2:00 rehearsal as well as the scene in which the accident occurred. Marshall was the executive producer of the "Twilight Zone" and participated at all meetings in which the hiring of the children was discussed and agreed upon. It was his job to participate and he has not denied that he did his job.</p>
         <p>... </p>

            <a><label for="redact-t12">
            Your office's statement that there was an exhaustive investigation is not only false with respect to Marshall, but is also false with respect to Spielberg. Spielberg was able to deflect the investigation away from himself by simply submitting a letter stating that he was not on the set the night of the accident. His full and complete knowledge and approval of what was to take place must be assumed and never has been disputed.</label></a></p>

            <a><label for="redact-t13">
            What other major witness could avoid questioning by signing a piece of paper? Your office never asked Spielberg a single question about the accident or the hiring of the children. Your claim that Spielberg was "unavailable" is simply false.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t14" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t14">
            Associate Producer Kathleen Kennedy (Spielberg segment) herself made the blind call to the Department of Labor. It was only when she received a negative reply to a question of getting permits for night work that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Kennedy was on the set the night before the accident when the children were present and the special effects were being set up while the helicopter rehearsed. Why has she not been interviewed?</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t15" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t15">
            The movie was a Warner Bros. production with scripts, budgets, and employees all approved by Warner Bros. The hiring of the children was expressly approved by Warner Bros. executives. Your office has never investigated which executives at Warner Bros. approved the illegal hiring of the children.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t16" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t16">
            Since your office has never charged anyone with the obvious conspiracy to employ minors without permits and the statute of limitations has now run, you might ask whether there is any purpose in pursuing the matter.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t17" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t17">
            The relevance is that many knowledgeable people participated in this employment and none of these people thought that the planned scene posed a danger to the children. In short, the breadth of the participation destroys the credibility of the charges that there was foreseeable danger.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t18" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t18">
            You might wish to start your investigation by questioning Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy. You should follow this up by questioning all the executives at Warner Bros. who participated directly or indirectly with the "Twilight Zone" movie. Each should be informed that the statute of limitations has expired and they can now talk freely without fear of prosecution. You might wish to determine how a corporate check was generated to pay these children and who signed the check. You might wish to ask your own investigators why these simple interviews have not taken place in the three and one half years since the accident.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t19" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t19">
            These observations should not come as any surprise to your office. The allegations concerning others participating in the agreement to employ minors without permits were replete at the preliminary hearing. Your own organization chart at the preliminary hearing showed Marshall at the top but your office says he was never questioned because you could not "find" him. Yet no letter was ever sent to Marshall, no letter was ever sent to his lawyers, and no attempt was ever made to serve Marshall with a subpoena either for the grand jury or the preliminary hearing.</label></a></p>

         <p><input type="checkbox" id="redact-t20" class="redact-toggle">
            <a><label for="redact-t20">
            Your office stated in the Los Angeles Times "that investigators attempted to interview Marshall and Spielberg but were unsuccessful because the men were either unavailable or out of the country when the grand jury was conducting its deliberations." This is ridiculous. The investigation went on for almost a year prior to the grand jury's deliberations. The investigators do not need the grand jury to go out and interview Marshall or Spielberg. Since your office flew the first assistant director from Israel to testify, it is strange to think that your office could not pay for a telephone call to either Marshall or Spielberg.</label></a></p>

         <figcaption>May 29th, 1987. Post-trial interviews (Double-click to play). After delivering the verdict, the jury requested and received permission from the judge to hold a joint press conference with the defendants. Once granted, the defendants rushed to the jury box, hugging and celebrating. Landis said it was 'like a Frank Capra movie,' referring to the classic Capra theme where ordinary people, guided by decency and integrity, prevail against adversity and institutional power (McBride 350—apocryphal? Cf. Chain Ch. 54).</figcaption>

      <p>Landis told reporters after the trial: “Almost five years ago, an accident happened on my set that killed three people. And nothing that happened here changes that.” </p>
      <p>He elaborated later, in an exclusive interview: “The concept of an accident is terrifying to people. ‘It must be somebody’s fault.’ And, as a participant in an accident, being there...  I don’t see the accident and the trial being the same... ”</p>
      <p>And finally, he challenged the DA’s integrity for pursuing the matter to begin with: “Candidly, Mrs. D’Agostino is grotesque, an aberration. And she is very unimportant. What is important is the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office spending this kind of money pursuing something that they know damn well is bogus” (LaBrecque 283).[^1]</p>
      <p>The verdict vindicated Landis and his many powerful allies in their causal analysis of the event as, simply, an unfortunate, unavoidable act of God:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>“...an industrial accident, nothing more.” (Actor Dan Aykroyd, 1982)</li>
         <li>“...obviously a human catastrophe...  not a criminal act.” (Universal Studios Production Executive Sean Daniel, 1985)</li>
         <li>“...a terrible tragedy [... ] terrible and horrible for everybody. But it was an accident. Which is eventually what the jury decided.

      <p>2:20am In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Marshall is reported by Chain to have emerged from his point of cover beneath a nearby truck, and joined the many dazed crew members wading towards the wreck looking for survivors.</p>

      <figure>

      </figure>

      <p>Chain cites House’s Trial testimony [??] that Marshall was the one to retrieve the body of Renee Chen and bring it to shore; Marshall ordered him to clear the set; and to make sure the film was on the truck; and also that Folsey and Marshall lead a wailing Mrs. Chen, and a startled shell-shocked Dr. Le to separate production vans headed for the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia.</p>
    
      <p>Car 1: Mrs. Chen</p>
      <p>Car 2: Jackie Compton [Driver]; Frank Marshall; John Landis; Dr. Le; George Folsey, Jr.</p>
    
      <p>There was a medic on-set, but no police. The nearest telephone was in a booth at the entrance of the Park. Deputies Sinclair and Straight, from the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station had received a call at 2:45am and arrived shortly after. Budds was dispatched at 4:15am and arrived at 6:10am, with fewer than a dozen witnesses remaining.</p>
      <p>That morning, Landis’s studio-assigned typist, Alpha Campbell, documented that at 10:15am Marshall called and “needs a lot of things,” and showed up to the office 15 minutes later and took—at least—several rolls of film.</p>
      <p>Chain reports that within days of the accident Marshall gave his account of events to Warner Bros’s attorneys, as documented in a series of interoffice memos (Chain Ch. 25; Ch. 27, etc.) [possibly—my speculation only—shared as a matter of discovery with defendants or suspects who participated in these unofficial depositions (e.g. hypothetically Elie Cohn), and then circulated among the defendants’ massive legal network].</p>
      <p>Farber & Green report that, “Right after the accident, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy left town to spend two weeks at Marshall’s retreat in Idaho. When they returned, Marshall stayed only a short time in Los Angeles; then left the country with Spielberg to scout locations for <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>” (158).</p>
      <p>By August 2nd, the Chen family had filed their lawsuit, in which both Spielberg and Marshall were named. Spielberg gave a more or less boilerplate (if arguably callous) response via his counsel.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier049.jpg">
         <figcaption>In October, Marshall filmed a cameo as one of four airplane ground crew (wearing a yellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_\(mythology\">Mercury</a>) wings hat; simply the conduit, messenger of Zeus) for George Miller’s segment Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, shot in October 1982.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier050.png">
         <figcaption><span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone: the Movie</span> was Marshall’s second cameo in a Spielberg movie. The first was as “the pilot” in Raiders of the Lost Ark’s striking tarmac fistfight set-piece.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>By October, according to Chain, Marshall had already been informed by CAL/Osha that his name was not being passed to the D.A. for indictment. In the initial confusion after the accident, with the jurisdictional considerations splitting the investigation into three factions, the NTSB interviewed some 31 witnesses to the accident, but Marshall was not among them. According to Chain, earlier, Marshall’s attorneys had petitioned the CAL/Osha investigator, Marilyn Levine, to exclude Marshall from her investigation, emphasizing the distance between Marshall (who operated on the Warner Brothers lot), and Landis’s people (who operated on the Universal Studios lot). Allegedly, when Marshall’s counsel misrepresented the number of days their client appeared on set, from at least 8 of 12 days, to only on the set three or four times total (Chain Ch. 39).</p>
      <p>And then in December, Spielberg and Kennedy at least were in town: finishing Spielberg’s <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> segment; hosting a Japanese television crew making a documentary; and having an early-December story bootcamp with Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck that established the plot for what became <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>.</p>
      <p>Oddly enough, Alpha Campbell also noted that On January 12, 1983, Frank Marshall returned to John Landis’s office to pick up a few more items.</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>1:40 PM — Phone Call:</p>
         <p>Michael Topher, Spielberg’s producer, called last night. He asked for the call sheet. I told him no one was here. He said he’d come look for it. I told him absolutely not — I shouldn’t let anyone into the office.</p>
         <p>Frank Marshall Pickup:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>24 boxes of trims</li>
            <li>170 boxes of <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> film materials (Picked up from Landis’s office)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>January 14, 1983 — Additional Pickup:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Lab roll sheets</li>
            <li><span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> camera reports</li>
            <li>1 code book (for <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span>)  </li>
            <li>1 lined script</li>
            <li>1 folder of miscellaneous <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> paperwork for editorial]</li>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <p>By this time, Budds had been trying to circle back to Marshall for a while, with his attorney assuring him Marshall was out of town and unavailable but would cooperate at the earliest possibility. Budds heard Marshall was back in town. But Marshall was never at his legal residence. And whenever Budds stopped by Universal Studios and the booth operator called ahead to the Amblin bungalow, Budds was always informed by Bonne or Mary Radford that Marshall was not on the lot at the moment but would he like to leave a message?</p>
      <p>By February 1983, Marshall’s attorney informed Sgt. Budds that his client had decided not to cooperate with investigators willingly. A domestic subpoena was issued for his testimony, but Marshall couldn’t be located at his home or work despite repeated visits by Sgt. Budds, and the case’s lone investigator had bigger fish to fry (LaBrecque 95). In the years to come the DA successfully navigated a grand jury hearing (June 1983), Preliminary Hearing (Feb 1984), and Appeal (June 1984).</p>
      <p>Spielberg and Kennedy at least were in L.A. for a disappointing 1983 Oscars, when Spielberg <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> failed to win the big award—the movie’s aura tainted, to whatever degree, by its association with the tragedy.</p>
      <p>The filming for Temple of Doom took place between April 18th, 1983 in Sri Lanka and continuing through September 8th, 1983, at Elstree Studios in London.</p>
      
      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier051.png">
         <figcaption>Then, sometime in 1985, all three of Marshall, Kennedy, and Spielberg were back in L.A., in Indian Dunes of all places, to film unscripted scenes depicting a coming-of-age ritual (a male and female circumcision ceremony), merely alluded to in the book, in Africa.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>George Folsey, Jr., told me [Ron LaBrecque] that the defendants, too, wanted Marshall to testify, to corroborate Landis's statements about the decision to hire the children illegally. He said that Landis talked to Spielberg after the preliminary hearing and asked him to intercede with Marshall. “Whether [Spielberg] attempted it, I don't know. Obviously, Frank went out of the country and avoided the subpoenas,” Folsey said.</p>

      <p>Cal/OSHA had decided back in the fall of 1982 that legally speaking Marshall wasn’t culpable for the hiring. But they were mistaken, as discovered by Allingham’s attorney Leonard Levine in 1985, when posing as a film producer and asking DLSE (Department of Labor Standards Enforcement) Chief of the Entertainment Work Permit Unit, Howard Bacon, whether in the case of an accident on-set the crew would be responsible, or the corporation and upper-level management, receiving an unequivocal answer that: </p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>... it was the production company which is deemed the sole employer of the minors, as well as of all other members of the cast, crew, and supporting personnel. If there is more than one production company or executive producer they are each jointly and severally liable as employers of the minors et al. If the production compani(ies) is incorporated its corporate officers are responsible under the Labor Code and the COMM’N’s regulations and guidelines as the employers of the minors. (Herrick cite)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Marshall was almost certainly a corporate officer at both Twilight Zone Productions, Inc. and DISC Management Systems, Inc. (the payroll company contracted to oversee the production’s spending).</p>
      <p>This, along with Braun’s two letters to the DA in November 1985, alleging that knowledge of the hiring was widespread, led to increased interest in Marshall’s testimony. With the statute of limitations expired, Marshall was no longer eligible for prosecution.</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Obviously, regardless of what the DA had done, I could have laid a subpoena on Frank Marshall at any time over a three-year period. But Behr [Landis’s personal lawyer] told me, ‘No, we’re not going to do that. It’s too dangerous to the clients’ careers.’ If Spielberg got mad at Landis, Landis could not get a job in this city. (qtd. in F&G 234)</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>In June 1986, the DA and the Sheriff’s Department tracked Marshall to London, England, where he was staying at St. James’s Hotel and Club, a luxury boutique hotel, working on Amblin’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit? at the famous Elstree Studios. Budds was sent overseas to personally serve Marshall a new subpoena, but because of his lack of jurisdiction, Budds had to enlist a young attache from the American Embassy to serve the legal document.</p>
      <p>Budds listened as she called Marshall from the front desk. He assured her he would be right down. They waited for him for half an hour but he never showed up. A report from Scotland Yard confirmed that Marshall was in Paris, where Spielberg also was at the time, promoting Amblin’s The Money Pit. The report speculated—based on the absence of Marshall’s names from any public flight records—that he had taken a private jet operated by Amblin Entertainment (cf. LaBrecque 128, F&G 241-243, McBride 348, Chain Ch. 42).</p>
      <p>Given the seriousness of the multiple-homicide trial at issue, INTERPOL became involved, and Marshall’s name was added to an international “stop and hold” list, along with his longtime girlfriend, Kathleen Kennedy. In fact, Kennedy was intercepted after landing in Barcelona in February 1987, and Marshall on April 7th, 1987, in Madrid (LaBrecque) for pre-production on Empire of the Sun.</p>
      <p>But by this time the prosecution had rested their case and Marshall’s testimony was no longer of any help.</p>

   <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>See Chain Ch. 47 [Summary: In his interview with Warner Bros.' legal team, Frank Marshall stated that he was standing across the river with location manager Dick Vane at the time of the accident and believed Vic Morrow was carrying dummies rather than real children. He claimed that he had been unaware of the illegal hiring of children and that George Folsey Jr. had misrepresented a $2,000 check he signed as a routine salary advance rather than payment for the child actors. Marshall asserted that he had raised concerns about proper permitting and had advised using older children with legal waivers, as Spielberg had done on <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, but alleged that Landis' team circumvented those precautions. While admitting he had discussed the children’s scenes in the script, he maintained that he did not know they would be used in the final shoot. His account, supported by Vane’s testimony, became part of Warner Bros.' legal strategy to distance the studio and Spielberg from liability while shifting responsibility onto Landis and his team. (ChatGPT)]. </p>
      <p>Even if the memo were spurious, it at least provides a plausible alternative to Landis et al’s narrative, rather than Marshall in particular (and the filmmakers more generally), who have successfully pursued a strategy of avoidance by omission.</p>
      <p>As well, Marshall implied the use of the children in the final shot, but not the 9:30pm shot, was the possible result of a semantic misunderstanding between him and Allingham during an early July meeting.</p>

One of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s defining quirks is the way it mythologizes its own unprecedented technological powers.

      <p><span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s dinosaurs were originally going to be achieved using a combination of animatronics, puppeteering, and stop-motion animated models, with CGI only to be used for subtle background work.</p>
      <p>The form of stop-motion they were using was called Go-Motion. Tippett had developed it at George Lucas’ special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, before starting his own company, Tippet Studio. Go-Motion worked by using a computer to synchronize a camera with motorized puppets, allowing for a motion blur effect that improved realism compared to traditional stop motion. ILM was going to help implement it.</p>
      <p>But when ILM received the commission in June ‘91 a few of their engineers thought they should be in charge, most notably Steve Williams and Mark A.Z. Dippé, who had been directly responsible for the astonishing but conspicuous CGI work on <span class="movietitle">The Abyss</span>, and <span class="movietitle">Terminator 2</span>, that won ILM two Oscars. Williams and Dippé thought CGI was ready, finally, to become invisible.</p>
      <p>But Dennis Muren, ILM’s VFX Supervisor, wasn’t so sure. He also didn’t want to venture in the direction of poaching a high-profile contract from a friend and colleague.</p>

      <p>Working in secret, Williams built a T-Rex skeleton from scratch—the same method he’d used for the T-1000. By November ‘91, he’d given it a walk cycle, in time for an anticipated [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgmvp7qXI_h58fomFO8QWLgV7HNldX7q/view?usp=share_link">visit</a>] by Amblin producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. He kept it playing on a monitor where they couldn’t help but notice it. To Kennedy, “it was immediately very clear that we were going to get realistic movement to these dinosaurs that was going to be far advanced from what we were doing with stop motion.” They commissioned further tests.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier059.png">
      </figure>
    
      <p>First, ILM delivered a demo of a herd of running gallimimus skeletons. Spielberg was astonished. The footage reminded him of National Geographic.</p>
      <p>“I looked at it and I couldn’t speak after watching it. I just couldn’t even catch my breath. I had never seen anything like it. Because even though it was just a skeletal frame of Gallimimus, this herd of Gallimimus was moving just as realistically as if we had taken a camera and filmed them for real.”</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier060.png">
      </figure>

      <p>But he needed to see a T-Rex walking in broad daylight before he could be sure. The engineers at ILM made 3D scans of the dinosaur models to make matching digital versions. That highly anticipated test was screened for Spielberg, Kennedy, Marshall, Tippett, and Lucas, among others.</p>
      <p>Everyone who was there to see it says they felt like they were witnessing the dawn of a new age. A computer generated entity passing for real.</p>
      <p>As Lucas said:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Everyone had tears in their eyes. It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call. A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.</p>
      </div>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier061.png">
      </figure>

      <p>As the story goes, Tippett declared himself “extinct,” although he was soon brought back into the fold as the dinosaur motion supervisor.[^4]</p>
      <p>Spielberg took the frisson of this world-historic moment and fed it back into the story.</p>
      <p>We can track this development in the changes that happened to the story between the first draft—developed with Michael Crichton and others through 1990 and 1991, before the decision to use CGI—and the final draft, developed with David Koepp through 1992.</p>

      <p>In October ‘89, Spielberg was chatting with Michael Crichton in his office about another project, when he found out about Crichton’s latest book, <span class="booktitle">Jurassic Park</span>, which Crichton had just delivered to his publisher. Crichton had written a screenplay about a graduate student cloning a pterodactyl from fossil DNA in 1983, but required several years to work out the kinks. Spielberg asked to read it, and the next day the two agreed they wanted to make it together. But in May 1990, as the book was getting ready for print, Crichton’s agents started a bidding war. Spielberg went to Universal Studios, to secure the funding, emphasizing the property’s franchising and theme park potential. They were especially interested in the T-Rex river chase.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier070.jpg">
      </figure>

      <p>In addition to $1.5 million, Crichton was paid $500,000 to write the first draft of the screenplay. He was sick of the dinosaurs and the characters at that point, but Spielberg said that they needed somebody to pare it down, fast. Crichton said he’d do it, with the provision that he’d eventually hand it off for someone else for the character polishes. He got started in July 1990, even before the book was released.</p>
      <p>Crichton delivered his first draft seven weeks later, on September 7th, 1990. Although this draft has never been published, in 2022, archivist Derrick Davis <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/michael-crichtons-jp-novel-to-screen">summarized</a> its contents. By Spielberg’s request, and Crichton’s intention, the first draft is a straightforward adaptation that <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/michael-crichtons-jp-novel-to-screen">“has all the big scenes retained and has the logical flow that appears in the much longer and more extended argument.”</a> It succeeded in establishing the general outline that would be used in the finished movie.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Grant, at the dig, is approached by Hammond or a representative</li>
         <li>Grant and Sattler meet the kids</li>
         <li>They fly to Isla Nublar</li>
         <li>They encounter the sauropods for the first time</li>
         <li>They get settled and head to the Visitor’s Centre</li>
         <li>They go to the theater, then to the genetics lab (the extraction lab, the fertilization lab, the hatchery, and the nursery) and then to the control room. Hammond defends the park against the critics</li>
         <li>There’s a scene at the raptor pen</li>
         <li>The group goes on a guided tour of the park as Hammond watches from the control room</li>
         <li>They stop to inspect a sick dinosaur and Sattler stays behind</li>
         <li>Nedry steps away, turns off the power, and runs off with the DNA</li>
         <li>The T-Rex breaks out of the fence and attacks the stalled cars</li>
         <li>The man riding with the kids runs out and is killed, and Malcolm is injured</li>
         <li>Grant and the children must evade the T-Rex as they make their way back to the Visitor’s Centre (initially including a river-rafting chase scene) while the rest of the group tries to recover them and debates how to restore the power.</li>
         <li>Once Grant and the kids return,
            s<ul>
               <li>Tim and Lex are chased by raptors into the kitchen,</li>
               <li>Ellie and Muldoon distract the raptors outside,</li>
               <li>Someone resets the power</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>One of the kids gets the computers back on in the Control Room</li>
         <li>There’s a showdown in the rotunda involving the T-Rex skeleton</li>
         <li>Hammond meets his fate</li>
         <li>They escape by helicopter</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Spielberg wasn’t satisfied with it. He said that it “start[ed] too fast.” The next draft included a prologue, and pushed back the scene where the visitors first see the sauropods, delaying the gratification of seeing the ‘monsters’, like in <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>. Crichton turned in his final ‘chunk’ on January 19th, 1991, and said he had taken his <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/06/JURASSIC-PARK-01-19-1991-Crichton-Re-Type.pdf">best shot</a>.</p>
      <p>The plot was still rough around the edges. But besides that, Crichton’s draft had flat characters, weak laughs, and lacked inspiration, failing to punctuate its emotional moments.</p>
      <p>Spielberg began shooting on Hook on February 19th, 1991, which ran overschedule and budget, occupying his attention until June. Soon after starting, Maria Scotch Marmo, who had just successfully reworked the character of Captain Hook, was enlisted to work on <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>. She found out from her husband that Amblin had optioned Crichton’s novel; she got a copy and was reading it outside the studio one day, when Kennedy noticed, started a conversation, and invited Marmo to try a rewrite. Marmo and Spielberg talked a lot about the story while shooting the movie, but Marmo only officially started her draft in October, and only finished it on <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/05/JurassicPark-FirstDraft.txt">March 14th, 1992</a>.</p>
      <p>Although Marmo read Crichton’s draft, she decided to start fresh and work from the novel. She said her principal contribution was to make Sattler and the children more assertive. Crichton had prioritized scientific verisimilitude, as he had in the book, but Spielberg said that “effects are only as good as the audience’s feeling for the characters.”</p>
      <p>Marmo also brought out the romantic comedy and “mating ritual” between Grant and Sattler, who’d already been married in Carter’s version. <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> gained much of its colour during her tenure. But overall her take was too juvenile. Spielberg said, simply, “I’ve read it twice, and I think it’s a miss.”</p>
      <p>At this point, Koepp was brought on from Robert Zemeckis’ Death Becomes Her (1992), and quickly pulled the script into shape in time for the production’s August start date. Koepp never even read the previous drafts.</p>
      <p>So goes the surface history of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>. But a closer look, aided by other materials unearthed by Davis, including early storyboards, story memos, and a lost draft by Production Designer Rick Carter (Back to the Future Part II), suggest a far more continuous development largely governed by Spielberg himself.</p>
      <p>When Crichton first met with Spielberg to discuss the script, Crichton had expected they would talk about dinosaurs. Instead <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Steven-Spielberg-Biography-Joseph-McBride/dp/1604738367">recalled Crichton</a>:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>as I scribbled hastily, he went through every character in the story, outlining their physical appearances, their motivations, their hopes and fears, their quirks and foibles. Ideas about dialogue, gestures, and costuming tumbled out. Speaking very rapidly, he went on like this for an hour.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This sort of creative “fugue state” is typical of Spielberg’s collaborations with his writers.</p>
      <p>Carter:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>On most shows, the production designer is brought in and handed a script and asked to visualize it. Not so on this one. I was in on many early meetings with Steven where we would break down the scenes in the book and discuss which ones would work best for the film.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Marmo:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>Usually writers get an assignment, go home, write it, and turn it in. We didn't work that way. I had feedback from Steven all the time. In fact, I would send him my first fifteen pages and he would react to them. Then I’d rewrite them a little in accordance with his wishes and send them back with the next fifteen pages, so he would have thirty. And that was pretty much the process for the whole five-month period.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Koepp:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>I had a collaborator who was absolutely gushing with ideas. It was more a case of me managing the firehose of good ideas that were directed at me.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Jim V. Hart, the original screenwriter for Hook, said that, “Steven tends to use writers like paintbrushes. He wants this writer for this, this writer for that.” </p>
      <p>Months before his first script meeting with Crichton in July ‘90, Spielberg was already working out the story. He’d pored through his copy of the book, highlighting his favourite passages and scribbling notes in the margins. What I wanted to do,” Spielberg said, “was boil the book down and choose my seven or eight favorite scenes and base the script around those. So we crunched the book.”</p>
      <p>Carter was the first creative professional brought onto the project, within weeks of acquiring the property. They hired seven artists to help conceptualize the story: five primarily doing storyboards (Marty Kline, Ed Varreaux, Tom Cranham, Dave Lowry, John Bell) and two primarily doing paintings (Dave Negron, and Craig Mullens).</p>

      </figure>

      <p>After they crunched the book and established its major setpieces, Spielberg started to dig in.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbzAydlW8ila7QoGbGzHA1qy6q1c_N6j/view?usp=share_link">Lowry</a>:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>The thing about a Steven movie is that Steven storyboards it first. And they carve out time for him to be able to sit and draw his rough thumbnails, and then our job becomes interpreting and re-drawing it as illustrators do, making them prettier drawings. But the bulk of—99% of—the shot ideas and the action, the schtick—I mean a lot of it’s in the script of course, it’s written as part of the story, all that happens—but the visualizing of it, and the making of those Spielberg moments is all Steven. And I mean, he’s a genius. Stan Winston said, ‘it’s no coincidence that Steven Spielberg is Steven Spielberg’. So for all those years with Steven, those were really great meetings. It would just be a couple of us in the room with Steven while he was drawing.</p>
      </div>

      <p>You could see him... —he was really big on drawing a sequence of drawings. The same shot going on for A, B, C, D, E, F—that many frames describing the action as it goes, and you’d sort of watch it as he was drawing it, as he was seeing it in his mind’s eye, and it would be pretty cool, because they’d be Steven moments.</p>
      <p>And then it would get to the end and you’d wait for the kicker. And he’d pause and he’d look off, and you’d realize that...  at first you’re thinking “oh he already thought this up so far, so that’s why it’s coming out so easy.” And then you realize he’s making it up as he goes, and he thinks of the kicker for the end of the scene, and you’d think ‘that’s so great, that’s wonderful.’</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier073.jpg">
      </figure>

      <p>Carter observed that Spielberg begins by envisioning a physical layout: “once he knows what the space is—that's very important, to know where things are—he'll just start playing a projector in his head. He’s open to contributions, and he’ll talk it through, but he'll actually draw these funny little frames which are incredibly detailed if you know how to look at them.</p>
      <p>These are a few of Spielberg’s “funny little frames” from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Very few are published.</p>

      <p>Koepp would later say he found the storyboards “enormously helpful. It was like having a large portion of the movie just handed to you, to be able to walk around and soak up the feel of what the movie’s supposed to be like.”</p>

      <p>By the time this sequence got to Koepp, it had already been locked. “I was handed a pile of storyboards. [...] The visual sequence was done, I just typed it up. And I got a very nice compliment, he said, “boy, that action is all so well-described.” (podcast)</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier078a.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Some of the recently published storyboards appear to have been produced prior to Crichton’s first draft.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier079.png">
      </figure>

      <p>In this frame, for example, we see an older Tim (11) and a younger Lex (7 or 8). These were their ages in the novel, and they were only reversed with Koepp’s draft, since Spielberg wanted Joseph Mazzelo as a younger Tim, and “realized that if I cast Lex younger than Tim, she would look about five years old—which was much too young to put in jeopardy with these dinosaurs. It would have turned the audience against us completely.”</p>
      <p>But here Lex is drawn with dark hair, while in Crichton’s novel (earlier) and his drafts (later) she’s described as a blonde. She’s also holding a doll, rather than the baseball mitt has in Crichton’s novel and both of his drafts. No accessory is mentioned in Carter’s version, and by Marmo’s it’s a flashlight instead.</p>
      <p>By Crichton’s first draft, the kids are described as being protected from the invading T-rex by a plastic bubble that “falls over them like a shield.”</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier080.png">
      </figure>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier080a.png">
      </figure>

      <p>We see Spielberg explaining this moment in an early production meeting.</p>
      <p>“Well, the prologue is where it eats the skylight, [unintelligible]—the big plexi comes out, and it actually protects the kids in a plastic bubble, but it frustrates the Rex who’s trying to get his mouth around the kids, but he’s got this plastic bubble in his way, he goes right through the top of the car, he leaves, the whole roof is just a big plastic bubble, it can just go inside the car and encapsulate them.”</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier081.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Afterwards, the T-Rex lifts the car into her jaws, attempting to eat the children alive. Lex falls out of the car into the mud, still holding her doll. Unlike in the book, however, she lands just underfoot of the T-Rex.</p>


      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier082.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Crichton’s first draft introduces more mutilation than exists in the corresponding scenes in the book. In the first draft, and only the first draft, The T. Rex is described as chomping down on Malcolm’s legs, and then pinning Ed Regis (a deleted tour guide character) into the mud with her claws. Then, according to Davis’ summary: “The rex grabs him in his jaws, and lifts him above the limbs of the tree. We don't see what happens. Body parts seem to fall, but it's hard to tell in darkness.” Then the gore showers onto Grant and the kids below. </p>
      <p>In Crichton’s second draft, Nedry’s body is discovered ripped into parts. </p>
      
      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier083.png">

      <p>In Marmo’s, the dismemberment is expressed as comic relief.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier084.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Even before finishing his first draft, Crichton was told to drop the Pterodactyl scene that had made the initial crunch. It was eventually used in <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park 3</span>:</p>
      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier085.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Finally, Crichton’s first draft contains a new ending. In the book, Hammond stumbles into a ravine, and is eaten alive by ‘compys’, small dinosaurs with narcotic venom.</p>
     <
     figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier086.jpg">

      <p>In Crichton’s first draft, this happens instead in the rotunda, after the hanging dinosaur skeleton and scaffolding crashes down onto him, pinning him to the ground.</p>
      
      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier087.png">
      </figure>

      <p>In general, the drafts of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> are rife with practical effects set-pieces collapsing along the vertical axis, replaying the dynamics of the <span class="movietitle">Twilight Zone</span> accident from various points of view. Generally: a man, boy, and girl engaged by a powerful ‘force’ from above (with special priority to the height of approx. 24-feet). These include:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>The helicopter descending onto a jungle clinic (novel; Carter; Koepp1)  </li>
         <li>The helicopter descending onto the dig site (Crichton2; Carter; all Koepp)  </li>
         <li>The helicopter’s turbulent descent onto Isla Nublar (all versions)  </li>
         <li>The T-Rex attacks the car, with Lex and Tim inside (all versions; in Koepp they are “pinned” to their seats).  </li>
         <li>The T-Rex lifting and dropping the car with Tim and Lex inside (novel through Carter; afterwards, the Rex just rolls the car, in Koepp’s Tim is “pinned” to the ground)  </li>
         <li>The T-Rex pushing the car over the ledge, with Grant and Lex hanging on below (Marmo and all subsequent versions)  </li>
         <li>Grant and Tim climbing down the tree, avoiding being crushed by the car (all versions)  </li>
         <li>Grant and the kids avoid swooping pterodactyls in the aviary (novel; removed during Crichton’s first draft)  </li>
         <li>Grant and the kids climb the electric fence (Marmo and all subsequent versions)  </li>
         <li>T-Rex attack during river rafting (removed with Koepp’s first draft; in Carter’s the raft is “pinned” by a falling tree)  </li>
         <li>Skeleton collapses in the Visitor’s Centre, “pinning” Hammond, Tim, or raptors to the ground variously (Crichton’s first draft and on)  </li>
         <li>T-Rex attacks the escaping helicopter (Carter, Marmo)[^5]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Crichton turned in his second draft on January 19th, ‘91. 3 days later, Spielberg, Carter, and Steve Starkey met to discuss the script with an eye to reducing the budget. And 6 weeks later, Carter turned in a draft of his own.[^6]</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier088.png">
      </figure>

      <p>While each of Spielberg’s writers attests to his close involvement, his exact influence is obscured by their product. Carter’s draft—a “collage” of notes and storyboards that claims mostly to reflect the state of the story pre-Hook—suggests a more transparent view into Spielberg’s vision for <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> as it existed after Crichton and before Marmo.</p>
      <p>Carter’s version is the only one bookended by helicopter scenes, beginning with the In-Gen helicopter, and ending with a military helicopter.</p>

      <p>Carter’s opening adapts the prologue from the book, in which some of Hammond’s men deliver an injured worker to a jungle clinic. Ed Regis tells the doctor that the worker was injured in a construction accident and mentions a “backhoe” but she suspects that he was mauled. In a line not in the book, she conveys her doubt by remarking that “it looks like he was eaten by a bulldozer.” The patient moans “lo sa raptor” before dying and then Carter cuts from the bite marks to the raptor jaws Grant is uncovering. The association between industrial machines and dinosaurs is echoed later on in a description that says that a trail deforested by dinosaurs looks like a “giant bulldozer went berserk.”</p>

      <p>In Koepp’s first draft (the only other version to contain the helicopter opening)—as in the book—the doctor looks up the definition of “raptor” and learns that it means “bird of prey.” Then, in Koepp’s early versions of the dig scene, the ROAR of the arriving helicopter is described as sounding “like some giant beast descending on the camp.” But Koepp also retains the bulldozer; he opens with a newly imagined scene that shows the accident itself, when a bulldozer, which also ROARS, attempts to push a crate into a holding pen, and an attending worker is slashed by whatever’s inside.</p>
      <p>In Crichton’s second draft, the lawyer that approaches from the helicopter is told that he’s standing on top of the skeleton. In Carter’s version, the helicopter lands “right on top of the dig site.” In Koepp’s early versions, the helicopter arrives at night. Grant “looks up at the helicopter and shouts, shaking his first.”</p>
      <p>In Carter’s version (only), during the Nublar helicopter descent, when the pilot loses control, Ellie asks Hammond if they’re going to crash. In Crichton’s second draft (only), it’s Lex who asks. In Marmo’s version (only) the helicopter is twice described as shaking violently.</p>

      <p>Carter’s draft closes by introducing the new “T-rex finale” that “came from Spielberg’s fertile mind” during the January 22nd ‘91 story meeting. In previous versions, the park had either been blown up by an army helicopter in a series of fiery explosions (Crichton’s first version) or destroyed by a genetically-engineered lysine deficiency akin to a plague (Crichton’s second).</p>

      <p>This version lasts through Marmo’s draft (in which it becomes an “army helicopter”), but is gone by Koepp’s: “I was not privy to that one. Steven must have moved on from that one before I got there.”</p>
      <p>On Marmo’s request, Spielberg lent her his personal copy of the galleys, with highlights and margin notes. She also stayed in touch with Crichton. Her version includes a description of a bearded Grant, and storyboards from this era feature Grant with glasses, an Asian Ellie (although Marmo is quoted as saying she pushed for Dern as Ellie), and the dark-haired Lex.</p>

      <p>By the time Marmo finished her script, Koepp had already been given his assignment and Spielberg’s full attention. He decided to start fresh from the novel rather than modifying earlier drafts. But he worked from the copious storyboards and ideas generated by the creative team in conjunction with the previous screenwriters and Spielberg. As well, during the writing, he received story notes from Marmo, and ongoing input from Spielberg, whom he found to have “wonderful suggestions for action scenes.”</p>
      <p>Spielberg had emphasized to Marmo that each scene should be “weighty with narrative ingenuity,” and Koepp continued the process of compressing the story. He refined the movie’s pairs of opposites, such as chaos-order, nature-artifice, man-woman, parent-child, science-religion, carnivore-herbivore, creator-creation, etc.</p>

         <p>The kids were kind of a challenge, because we didn’t want it to seem like they were there just to have kids in the movie. Steven, in particular, is vulnerable to criticism like that, because he likes to work with kids. He works with kids awfully well, so it’s not entirely fair, but the perception is there nonetheless. So our challenge was to find out why these kids were essential to the movie. (Koepp, qtd. in <a href="https://archive.org/embed/makingofjurassic00shay">Shay</a> 57)</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Koepp turned in an early <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p43QNiLaMC6B4ZqEn6bL9dfRyuHCA3on/preview">working draft</a> sometime between April 23rd and May 1st, 1992; a draft on May 26th, of which only <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2781141168611237&type=3">10 pages</a> have been released; an update on June 30th (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1462818743776826&type=3">full script</a>); followed by numerous revisions during principal photography, with a Final Shooting Script dated <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFPTKCbNCldFvg4eNWpW_UONPZAb54EQ/preview">November 11th</a> and a Final Draft dated <a href="https://controlroom.jurassicoutpost.com/app/uploads/2016/05/JurassicPark-Final.pdf">December 11th, 1992</a>.</p>
      <p>Koepp’s version, like all previous versions but Marmo’s, expands on a moment of criminal negligence from Crichton’s novel. The novel includes three separate dinosaur incidents on mainland Costa Rica: (1) the arrival by helicopter of a young (“no older than 18”) injured worker to a jungle clinic; (2) the attack of a young girl by compys (later used in The Lost World); and (3) a fatal attack on an infant by compys while a nanny is distracted. Eventually word of the strange lizards is funneled to Columbia University, where it’s redirected to Dr. Grant for his expert opinion. This coincides with the arrival of Grant’s research funder, Hammond, whom Grant has been informed has been buying up amber. Later in the movie, Grant spies baby velociraptors stowing away on the supply ship. Besides Crichton’s second draft, which includes the second incident (a scene discarded within days), the drafts focus on the first incident. </p>
      <p>Koepp’s first draft drops the idea of the raptors already having made it to the mainland, but opens for the first time with the “bulldozer accident.” He then reintroduces Carter’s jungle clinic scene, including Crichton’s beat of the doctor learning that a “raptor” is a “bird of prey.” And he continues with a scene at an amber mine, first conceived in Marmo, but now with Hammond learning that the injured worker is suing them for $2 million dollars. In every subsequent version this is adjusted to $20 million. By the May version, Koepp and Spielberg realized that the jungle clinic beat was just a rehash of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>’ “this is not a boat accident.” They omitted it, but allowed the original accident to remain as a catalyst for the investors to pressure Hammond, who must then court Grant’s approval to smooth over the disturbance.</p>
      <p>Koepp’s crucial tweak was making Dr. Grant hostile towards children, creating a dramatic tension that doesn’t exist in the novel or previous versions. Grant uses his prop claw (introduced in Crichton’s second draft) to slash at and terrorize a child—already re-enacting the opening scene.[^8]</p>
      <p>Koepp finally removed the raft sequence, which he found “rather redundant.” The <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> River Adventure at Universal Studios had been being developed since at least May 1990. Spielberg <a href="https://youtu.be/TJmn5UUbYss?si=JNOegpuHJGwEl3rK&t=1335">called</a> it “a three-dimensional chance to live the movie,” although he admitted he would be stepping out before the steep drop at the end, being, himself, afraid of heights.</p>
      <p>Koepp also continued to develop the ending. Each draft since Crichton’s first develops a scene involving the collapse of the T-Rex skeleton in the rotunda (not in the book). In Crichton’s first draft, we recall, it collapsed onto Hammond. In his second, it collapses as Grant climbs it, and serves as a distraction. In Carter’s, Tim and Lex try to escape the raptors by climbing into the T-Rex’s rib cage, to no avail; Grant arrives at the last minute, presses some control buttons, which causes the skeleton to collapse, with the T-Rex skull crushing one of the raptors. Marmo’s version is similar. Koepp’s refines the concept further, introducing a ‘Condor’ crane that Grant maneuvers to knock down the skeleton, ripping it from the ceiling and sending cables and bolts down like bullets, and with the skull decapitating the raptor—’beheading’ it in an especially literal sense.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier108.jpg">
      </figure>

      <p>In the final draft (the change was only made on-set) the skeleton collapses on top of Tim—marking the third time that a chassis has done so.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier112.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Koepp also completes the rehabilitation of John Hammond. After Hammond was crushed in Crichton’s first draft, he distracts the raptors in the second, sacrificing himself in a final act of redemption to save the kids.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier113.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Carter’s version is similar, except that Hammond admits to knowing the DNA was unstable and that the park was never tenable. In Marmo, he admits it but blames it on his employees, and is left behind and dies. In Koepp’s first draft, he admits he knew, but blames it on himself, and stays behind but we don’t see him die. By Koepp’s June 30th ‘92 draft, the DNA isn’t inherently unstable, Hammond’s culpability for the park and bringing the kids there is unclear, and he is brought along on the helicopter. Koepp <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/script-apart/id1518622561?i=1000616197924">speaks</a> to the softening of Hammond directly: “Steven identified with him, whether consciously or not.” </p>
      <p>Marmo said, “I thought [Hammond] was insane because he made a park that had raptors and T. rexes in it and still he brought his grandchildren to it before it had a real safety check. He took his own grandchildren to a potentially lethal park to use them as pawns.” But, “Steven wanted a sunnier captain of the Jurassic ship; he was clear about that.”</p>
      <p>By the final draft, the question of culpability for the story’s concrete acts of negligence—the young worker mauled by a raptor whose family is suing Hammond for 2 or 20 million dollars; the boy and girl repeatedly threatened with violent death—is overshadowed by Hammond’s idealism and the ultimate rescue of the children.</p>
      <p>But Koepp’s versions also enact a more fundamental reframing. In the book, Dr. Wu compares DNA to photography: “The DNA of the dinosaurs was like old photographs that had been retouched, basically the same as the original but in some places repaired and clarified... ” (137). The analogy begun in the textual form of <span class="booktitle">Jurassic Park</span> the book only comes to full reflexivity in <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> the movie which is, of course, a sequence of hundreds of thousands of retouched “old photographs.” Koepp’s draft marks the arrival of a meta-consciousness concerning not only the movie’s own character as a theme park attraction, but as a state of the art technology demonstration.</p>
      <p>Reconstituting the components of the miracle at ILM, Koepp’s first draft restores the early brachiosaurus scene from Crichton’s first draft and sequences it next to the movie theatre/computer lab/genetic nursery, amalgamated into a single rotating theme park ride.</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>I’d love to take credit for it, but I think it was Steven’s idea. It was brilliant. We could pop in for a few seconds here and there, put up some essential bits of information, and then get out. ...  and it would make sense because it’s all part of the amusement park environment. ... </p>
      </div>

      <p>But, Koepp continues:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>It was funny, but it was getting into a pretty weird area. Here I was writing about these greedy people who are creating a fabulous theme park just so they can exploit all these dinosaurs and make silly films and sell stupid plastic plates and things. And I’m writing it for a company that’s eventually going to put this in their theme parks and make silly little films and sell stupid plastic plates. I was really chasing my tail there for a while trying to figure out who was virtuous in the whole scenario—and eventually gave up.</p>

      <p>This conscious, ironic meta-reference became the finishing layer of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s aesthetic.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier115.png">
      </figure>

      <p>Spielberg was dreaming himself into his movies—as he always did—but had intuited a strange new hook. It was a dream about discovering a new power for making dreams come true—just as, in reality, he was.</p>

      <p>Throughout the story, they remind the spectator of their newly harnessed powers for capturing the imagination.</p>
      <p>As critic Nigel Morris puts it:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p><span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> inflects knowledge, always present in spectatorship, that what is experienced is not real—though the experience is real and what is experienced may be realistic—by heightened awareness of the stimuli’s synthetic nature.[^9]</p>

      <p>This shifting was both cause and effect, a mesmerizing feedback loop that bounded the spectator’s sense of being both safely protected behind a screen and completely enveloped in the story.</p>

      <figure>
         <img src="../img/dossier119.png">

      <p>This allowed a new transparent dimension that could be saturated with advertising that didn’t feel like advertising. By pretending it was criticizing itself, it disarmed the spectator, whose criticisms they heard addressed, and neutralized.</p>

   <div class="accordion-content">

      <p>Spielberg’s most comprehensive biography to date is Joseph McBride’s <span class="booktitle">Steven Spielberg: A Biography</span>, first published in 1997.* But it was “unauthorized”. Spielberg has always discouraged potential biographers, telling them that he was planning to write his own autobiography at some time in the future.</p>
      <p>McBride notes Spielberg’s desire to “control the telling of his own life story.” He complains:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>I am constantly surprised by how many people, including some in the literary world, react with automatic suspicion when they hear the phrase “unauthorized biography,” as if there were something inherently dubious about a book not having the subject's seal of approval. On the contrary, what should arouse the reader's suspicions are the inevitable constraints placed on an author's integrity by the decision to allow his subject to authorize and thereby to control the writing of the book. By talking endlessly about his life in press and television interviews to promote his movies, Spielberg already has given us an autobiography of sorts, albeit a scattered, fragmentary, and sometimes misleading one; what largely has been missing from the picture is an independent examination of his character, seen not simply through his eyes alone but also through the perspectives of the people who have known and worked with him throughout his lifetime.*</p>
      </div>

      <p>McBride details some of these “misleads” in his work. Spielberg has a habit of telling “fibs”. Most famously over the years, for example, he’s told various more-or-less elaborate versions of how he got his break at Universal Studios. The template is that he sneaks off a tour, hides in the bathroom, and then occupies an office and gradually insinuates himself into the studio. The truth (which is no less impressive) is that his father’s colleague contacted the Universal Studios librarian, Chuck Silvers, who got Spielberg a day-pass and offered to show him around. Spielberg made a strong impression on him, and Silvers offered him a summer internship, but couldn’t get him a pass, and so Spielberg had to find his own way onto the lot.*</p>
      <p>It may seem trifling to address such imprecisions, but many of these fibs sustain a weird purchase in reality. In 1970, Spielberg subtracted a year from his age, an adjustment he maintained in the media and on government documents, like his driver’s licence, until 1995 (past the time of <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>) when it was only corrected as the result of a lawsuit. In 1975, his adjusted age allowed him to void an unfavourable contract on the basis that he’d signed it before he was 21. It was only after McBridge sought out Spielberg’s birth certificate and published the history of the claims that the counter-party was able to settle their valid legal dispute.</p>
      <p>Spielberg started making good on his promise of an autobiography as early as 2002, with <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span>. Of course, as we have seen, Spielberg’s work generally has a strong autobiographical tendency. But <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span> signalled a “more literal” reflection of his own family trauma.</p>
      <p>Despite his frequently told anecdote suggesting his lack of susceptibility to Freudian analysis, he also began to admit the opposite. In conversation with Scorsese about the film at the time of its release, Spielberg noted that:</p>
      <p>“The older I get, the more I go back to the early memories to get me to commit to a movie. It takes sometimes something very Freudian to get me to say, 'Well, this is interesting; I better read beyond page fifty.'” </p>
      <p>In 2017, HBO produced Spielberg’s first authorized biography: <span class="booktitle">Spielberg</span> (2017). Spielberg’s mother, Leah Adler, encouraged him to turn it into a movie.</p>
      <p>Spielberg has always been fascinated by coming-of-age stories, but in 2022, with <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> he finally turns the lens onto himself—still displacing his story onto fictional characters but to the minimal degree. And it’s precisely by undermining this apparent transparency that he begins to reveal the distortions that characterize his technique.</p>
      <p>In an interview with director Paul Thomas Anderson, Spielberg once again describes his working relationship with screenwriter Tony Kushner as a sort of therapy session, acknowledging his first (but not his second) therapy experience.*</p>
      <p><span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> begins like Bergman’s <span class="movietitle">Scenes from a Marriage</span>—a 1973 6-part TV series about the disintegration of a marriage—before finding its shape or “splitting” as Paul Thomas Anderson puts it.* </p>
      <p>Spielberg has previously used <span class="movietitle">Scenes from a Marriage</span> as a shorthand for the difference between him (and George Lucas) and Scorsese (and the rest of New Hollywood). One style he says, is introspective, and “concentric” while the other is a “complete thought” and “more linear.”</p>
      <p>The story unfolds in the vein of Malick’s <span class="movietitle">Tree of Life</span> or Tarkovsky’s <span class="movietitle">Mirror</span>. Spielberg mythologizes his own biography as a genesis of myth-making, turning the particulars of his life—like having three younger sisters, being a Jew among Christians, and the child of an unstable marriage—into elements of a paradigmatic creation myth populated by the gods and goddesses of cinema. </p>
      <p>The movie opens with one of Spielberg’s earliest memories: his mother and father taking him to the movies.</p>
      <p>His parents are emblems of the Greatest Generation; his mother is a creative spirit playing the role of a housewife, and his father is an engineer laying the foundations of the personal computer.*</p>
      <p>When describing the memory elsewhere, Spielberg emphasizes two impressions: feeling overwhelmed and feeling deceived.</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>So the curtain is open and I expect to see the elephants and there's nothing but a flat piece of white cardboard, a canvas. And I look at the canvas and suddenly a movie comes on and it's <span class="movietitle">The Greatest Show on Earth</span>. At first I was so disappointed, I was angry at my father, he told me he was taking me to a circus and it's just this flat piece of color. [... ] For a while I kept thinking, Gee, that's not fair, I wanted to see three-dimensional characters and all this was was flat shadows, flat surfaces. I was disappointed by everything after that. I didn't trust anybody. I never felt life was good enough, so I had to embellish it.</p>
      </div>

      <p>But in <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> this moment is played for awe. It’s superimposed over another, more primal memory, which he described to Time magazine in 1985: being wheeled down the aisle of a synagogue towards the red light of the Ark of the Torah, while elders on each side chanted prayers in rhythm and handed him crackers. And when asked in 1991 to choose a “master image” that recurs throughout his work, Spielberg chose that of Barry, the toddler from <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>, approaching “that beautiful but awful light, just like fire.” Spielberg’s first memory is also his “master image,” and here he layers it under the later memory, rendering the cinematic image as the penultimate expression of the divine fire.</p>
      <p>These two memories give way to a third: inspired by the train crash in the middle of The Greatest Show on Earth, Spielberg begins to crash his own trains together by flashlight.</p>
      <p>His mother reflects on the artistic fulfillment she feels while playing Bach, especially when she descends into the lower octave of one of his laments, describing it as “making a world you can be safe and happy in,” and infers from this that crashing trains is her son’s way of gaining a sense of control over his life. His father isn’t conscious of it, but he takes just as much pleasure in tinkering with his machines.*</p>
      <p>The subsequent scene plays like Freudian pornography (clip). And later, when the family goes camping just after he turns 16, his mother dances in a nightgown as the men of the family gaze on. His father’s best friend tells Sammy that he should be filming this, and turns on the headlights of the car behind her, making her gown transparent. Once again the illuminated moving image is infused with ambivalence. The embarrassed elder daughter tries to block her, but Sammy urges her to sit down, which the father doesn’t overrule.</p>
      <p>Later, while editing the dancing footage on his father’s request, he notices evidence of his mother having an affair with the friend. This is the moment that gives the movie its “shape,” echoing the earlier “secret,” and splitting Sammy from the rest of his family.</p>
      <p>Sammy and his mother, as co-conspirators, play out an emotional affair in parallel to her actual affair, which eventually results in the family’s divorce. Spielberg had been accused of making Disney movies about incest before, with The Colour Purple and Back to the Future, and now the veil is even further lifted.</p>
      <p>As Jocasta says to Oedipus in Sophocles’ tragedy, “many a man has slept with his own mother in a dream.”</p>
      <p>But even when the movie’s psychosexual elements are made explicit, they hardly register until they become so loud that they’re hard to ignore. Once young Steven reaches senior year in Saratoga, his power to control reality becomes activated, not only within the story, but conspicuously in its telling.</p>
      <p>After being bullied by two blonde antisemites, Sammy later finds himself in a private, playful moment in the library with one of their girlfriends and her friend. When the girlfriend points out that he’s Jewish, he replies, in close-up, “I mean, yeah, since the day I was circumcised.” The friend becomes attracted to him, associating him with Jesus (who was also Jewish, and circumcised), and invites him over to her room, covered in posters of Jesus and Elvis, so that Sammy might let Jesus “come inside him,” the first of many such double entendres.</p>
      <p>Eventually Sammy gets his revenge on the bullies by screening a movie of the senior beach day that he’s edited to show the smaller Aryan as a thieving loser, and the bigger one as an Olympic god, including a close-up of his lower body while running. The bewildered pair turn against each other, and after Sammy admits his exact motives are unclear even to himself, he promises never to tell of the humiliation, “unless I make a movie about it.”</p>
      <p>The autobiography is too Freudian to take at face value. Spielberg is playing with us the same way he says he played with his first therapist. The meta-implication is that Spielberg is showing us what it means to have a power to manipulate reality to make it safer for himself. It was in Saratoga that he realized that his movie camera could be used not only as his vehicle to social acceptance but as a “defensive weapon”.</p>
      <p>Spielberg’s making conspicuous of his power for shaping reality is his way of telling us that there are some things he can’t talk about, even at the sunset of his career, when the brick and mortar movie theatre has become the relic of a bygone era.</p>

      <p>Steven Spielberg’s <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> (1993) recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. In the years since its release, its intellectual property has grown into a “cottage industry,” encompassing theme-park rides, toys, apparel, video games, product placement, and five sequels, with a new “Jurassic era” set to begin in 2025. While Spielberg had already directed other movies that were hugely profitable, some, like <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> (1975), <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> (1977), and <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> (1982), weren’t “toyetic,” as Mattel’s CEO once observed about <span class="movietitle">Star Wars</span> back in 1977; and the other, <span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones</span>, belonged to George Lucas. <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> was the first, and last, enduring merchandising empire that Spielberg could call his own.</p>
      <p>At the time, <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> represented a breakthrough in cinema technology, marking the first time that a blockbuster depended on CGI that looked and moved realistically. It became the herald for the coming digital revolution, which Spielberg talked about with a mixture of excitement, melancholy, and trepidation.[^10] The filmmakers even integrated this characteristic into <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s brand identity. At the same time as <<span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> movies operate at the cutting edge of creative technology, their stories are about the perennial danger of cutting-edge creative technologies, adding a new meta-referential gloss to the classic technology-critical story archetype (e.g., Prometheus, Golem, Frankenstein, Godzilla).</p>
      <p>But <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> also had a more personal significance. By 1992, Spielberg was in his mid-40s and onto his second marriage, with Kate Capshaw, who had just converted to Judaism, renewing Spielberg’s faith in the process. They had one child each from their previous marriages (Max and Jessica), one adopted son (Theo), and two children of their own (Sasha and Sawyer). But he was still facing a transition to adulthood: both in his upcoming responsibilities of running a major Hollywood studio, Dreamworks SKG; and in the seriousness required by <span class="movietitle">Schindler’s List</span> (1993), which was being treated by Sid Sheinberg, Spielberg’s mentor at Universal Studios, as Spielberg’s arrival into his own identity as a mature filmmaker. It was his cinematic bar mitzvah and an emotional breakthrough.</p>
      <p>According to biographer Joseph McBride, Spielberg’s movies of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s reflected the filmmaker working through several of his well-publicized neuroses: his resentments towards his father (<span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</span>); his divorce from his first wife, Amy Irving (<span class="movietitle">Always</span>); and his own Peter Pan complex (<span class="movietitle">Hook</span>). It was around this time that Spielberg had been trying some psychotherapy. </p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>All my friends went to therapy and I thought that maybe I would learn something about myself, so I went for a year. But I can't say that I found the discoveries conclusive. Everything I learned about myself I knew already or I'd guessed for myself.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Spielberg was reportedly in talks with celebrity psychologist <a href="https://www.johnbradshaw.com/blog/2018/10/5/oh-pablum-why-hollywoods-latest-guru-john-bradshaw-is-turning-everyone-from-spielberg-to-streisand-into-crybabies-published-in-los-angeles-magazine">John Bradshaw</a>, a guru specializing in healing the inner child, by imaginatively regressing his subject(s) back to their early childhood. According to Bradshaw, Spielberg was deeply impressed by his work. Los Angeles magazine reported that in February of 1992, they met at Spielberg’s house to discuss a TV show Spielberg had been convincing him to do. Bradshaw says, “Steven looked at me on the set of <span class="movietitle">Hook</span> and said, ‘This could be the most powerful television program of all time.’”[^11] Spielberg must have valued something about Bradshaw’s analysis, as he hired him as an on-set consultant for Hook, and cast his daughter in the movie.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>In this context, <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> always seemed like one last summer vacation. Sheinberg had insisted Spielberg get <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> done before <span class="movietitle">Schindler’s List</span>: “he knew that once I had directed <span class="movietitle">Schindler</span>, I wouldn't be able to do <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>."</p>
      <p>One critic summed it up as follows:</p>
      
      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>The paring-down of a monster best-seller into a suspense machine (<span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>); the tackling of a popular-science childhood sense of wonder perennial with state-of-the-art effects that re-imagine 1950s B-science fiction (<span class="movietitle">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span>); the all-action jungle adventure littered with incredible perils and gruesome deaths (<span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>); and big-eyed creatures who range from beatifically benevolent to toothily murderous (<span class="movietitle">Gremlins</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>).[^12]</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>But what if <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> wasn’t a break from Spielberg’s therapeutic phase, but its pivotal moment?</p>
      <p>Spielberg’s movies, despite their epic scale, have always had a prominent autobiographical dimension. In Susan Lacy’s HBO documentary <span class="movietitle">Spielberg</span> (2017), he said that “I’ve managed to avoid therapy because movies are my therapy.”</p>
      <p>He’s described his movies as being more or less “literally” reflective of his own life, especially <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> (1982)[^13] and even more so <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span> (2002). In 2022, he made the most literal reflection yet, <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span> (2022), which he called a “$40-million dollar therapy session.”</p>

         <figcaption>The patient would lie down on a sofa, while Freud sat behind him. The patient agreed to “say whatever came into his head, while ceasing to give any conscious direction to his thoughts.”</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The purpose of free association was the same as therapeutic hypnosis had been before it: to isolate maladaptive tendencies in the patient’s unconscious mental processes and resolve them, but it had been modified to isolate a subtle form of what Freud called “transference.”</p>
      <p>Freud started out as a brain scientist, studying the psychological manifestations of bodily illnesses. One day, his friend, a medical doctor named Josef Breuer, told him about a woman he was treating who suffered from “clouded” mental states. Breuer had figured out that if, while she was in one of these states, she was led to talk through it, her condition would improve. He also found out that he could induce these states by way of therapeutic hypnosis. Once she was under his spell, he would urge her through other cloudy memories. She said the process felt like “chimney sweeping”—clearing out the cobwebs. Breuer was vague about some complications at the end of her treatment, but otherwise, he told Freud, it was a perfect test case for a potential “talking cure” to psycho-physical disorders.</p>
      <p>Freud reasoned that some memories could only be accessed during these sorts of fugue states because they had been so shameful by the patient’s own standards that some part of their mind kept it from being consciously realized, or “repressed” it, and “resisted” attempts to bring it to light. The patients felt vaguely guilty. But avoiding the issue was starting to take up too much of their mental energy. If they could just be brought back to the original incident, and urged through it “with a free expression of emotion,” the two men theorized, the pent-up energy would be released (“catharsis”) and their condition resolved.</p>
      <p>But Freud had started to suspect that some of his patients’ traumatic memories were embellished. And one day, one of his most acquiescent female patients, as she was waking up from her trance, tried to kiss him. The same thing had happened to Breuer.</p>
      <p>He realized that he’d failed to account for the patient’s resistance towards the therapeutic work, especially as it applied to their perception of him. He was just as subject to the patient’s charms as anyone else: thus, he was susceptible to their resistance to engaging in the therapeutic process. They would respond to him in exaggeration of what was reasonable, which could either take the form of intensified positive feelings (compliance, love) or negative ones (criticism, anger). Either way, this exaggeration, since it was woven into the therapeutic relationship, was difficult to detect, and even harder to prove. He realized that he’d only ever been part of his patients’ own distorted narratives. Although they improved over the short-term, their symptoms soon returned.</p>
      <p>With free association, instead, he began by assuming the patient was an unreliable narrator about the origins of their own illness. Instead, he would just have them talk about their dreams. Freud theorized that dreams provided the closest point of contact with the unconscious part of their mind, but the beauty of his method was that even to a skeptic, the new focus on dreams would provide a more random and varied sample of ideas, associated with the people and affairs of the patient’s daily life. Either way, the patient’s underlying associative tendencies would be targeted.</p>
      <p>And now, when the transference occurred, the practitioner would be better equipped to see it for what it was, and explain it using the patient’s own associative links, which could be traced all the way back to early childhood. This newly opened second front allowed the practitioner to flank the patient mentally, preparing them for a moment of sudden self-recognition, should they choose to accept it. This new method required the hypnotist to become an analyst. He had to listen carefully to detect the clues to the relevant underlying issue; the process could not be standardized or reduced to an algorithm. It was always an inflection, streaming, state-of-the-art, tuned to the moment.</p>
      <p>And then Freud realized something else. At the same time as he’d discovered this new science of psychoanalysis, he’d also discovered the science of dream analysis.</p>
      <p>Dreams, like the cloudy memories of his patients, had an underlying “meaning,” in the sense of a concealed motive contributing to the production of the dream. The evolutionary or biological function of dreams was to fulfill unconscious wishes: that is, to condition the dreamer to a favorable version of reality.</p>
      <p>And this, actually, implied a third new science—Freudian art criticism—and a fourth—consumer psychology. Man’s creative products—artwork—could, like dreams, be viewed as imaginary gratifications of unconscious wishes. The analyst just needed to factor out their conscious orientation towards an audience: the artworks “were calculated to arouse interest in other people and were able to evoke and to gratify the same unconscious wishes in them too.”</p>
      <p>If any random assortment of things could be analyzed for its underlying associative structure, and dreams could be fruitfully considered this way, then dreams could be solved; could be shown to have an underlying ‘meaning’, in the sense of a concealed motive justifying the energy required to produce the dream. The evolutionary or biological function of dreams is to help grant the wishes of the dreamer: that is, to condition the dreamer to a version of reality favorable to the achievement of their goals. </p>
      <p>They were, said Freud, the product of a wishful impulse “often of a very repellent kind, which is foreign to the waking life of the dreamer and is consequently disavowed by him with a surprise of indignation.”</p>
      <p>Freud, by analyzing his own dreams, outlined the basic ways the dream’s real purpose concealed itself. It expressed itself through an ongoing narrative, with multiple people from life being “condensed” into singular dream figures, and the actual functions of the dream “displaced” onto seemingly minor details. It was then finished with a “deceptive secondary revision,” with the relatively conscious side of the mind doing a bit of extra polishing. It was only as the analyst paid attention to the patient’s associative patterns, rather than their interpretations, that the underlying story became visible.</p>
      <p>And if dreams were basically stories, then this implied two more sciences: one of art criticism, and another of consumer psychology. Man’s artworks, like dreams, could be decoded as imaginary gratifications of the artist’s unconscious wishes. The analyst just needed to factor out their conscious orientation towards an audience: the artworks “were calculated to arouse interest in other people and were able to evoke and to gratify the same unconscious wishes in them too.”</p>
      <p>Already, in his father’s analyst’s office, Spielberg was taking cover behind a removed form of free association. And, as we will continue to see, his stream-of-consciousness stories became the prototype for how he would engage with screenwriters over the course of his career.</p>
      <p><span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> was produced by Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips for Columbia Pictures (with Julia taking the lead, as Michael had taken the lead on <span class="movietitle">Taxi Driver</span>).  </p>
      <p>Spielberg had been developing the premise for a while, but Paul Schrader was originally hired to write the screenplay. Spielberg outlined the premise and key images for Schrader, who interpreted it as a retelling of the gospel of St. Paul: an unbeliever has a spiritual encounter that changes the direction of his life. Spielberg hated Schrader’s script (“Kingdom Come”) which he called “one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major studio or director...  a terribly guilt-ridden story, not about UFOs at all.” Schrader said, “The only thing I deserve a credit for...  is changing Steve's mind about doing the film as a UFO Watergate. I thought it ought to be about a spiritual encounter. That idea stayed and germinated.”</p>
      <p>After another rewrite or two by others, Spielberg decided to write the screenplay himself. Spielberg and Phillips honed the idea of a climactic moment of transcendence they referred to as “The Experience.” These pockets of spiritual denouement would become a characteristic feature of Spielberg’s work.</p>
      <p>Kael found <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> to be a “kids’ movie in the best sense.” It was joyous and optimistic. But while she was dazzled by its mixture of the transcendent and the infantile, she was beginning to see Spielberg less in Dreyfuss’ “man looking for answers” and more in the toddler Barry, a “light-worshiper who sees the sky as a giant toy shop.”</p>
      <p>In the wake of Star Wars’ transformation of the cinematic landscape, and the rise of SNL, Spielberg became more assured in dispensing with the pretensions of his New Hollywood milieu and exploring his comedic sensibilities. He was fostering two younger filmmakers, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, who specialized in screwball comedies steeped in American history. He had recommended them to the most conservative of his New Hollywood cohort, John Milius, whose A-Team Productions hired them to develop the script that would become Spielberg’s next movie, <span class="movietitle">1941</span> (1979).</p>
      <p>The foursome began hanging out together, skeet shooting and then going out for chili-burgers and doing bigfoot impressions while Spielberg filmed it all on his Super-8 camera. “Great howling mad evenings...  out of which came <span class="movietitle">1941</span>,” said Milius.</p>
      <p>Spielberg <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17BXzSqbuFJXhjHBKG7wbq5ir0GN5DI3s/view?usp=sharing">recognized himself</a> as being in competition with John Landis, whose <span class="movietitle">Animal House</span> (1978) became the highest grossing comedy in history.</p>
      <p>1941 was the third time in a row that Spielberg had gone over time and budget, but this time it was a bomb. Spielberg soon disavowed the movie, the first of three times, before 1993, that he would do so (<span class="movietitle">Temple of Doom</span> (1984) and <span class="movietitle">Hook</span> (1991) being the other two).</p>
      <p>Spielberg said, “I plunged into [<span class="movietitle">1941</span>] with such wild abandon that I didn’t really focus on the story I was telling, to know whether it was funny or simply stupid or whether the film was getting too overblown...  On about the hundred and forty-fifth day of shooting, I realized that the film was directing me, I wasn’t directing it.”</p>
      <p>At the time, he blamed his writers, telling the <span class="booktitle">New York Times</span> that they “caught me at a weak moment. I’ll spend the rest of my life disavowing that movie,” although he apologized to them right after. Kael liked it.</p>
      <p><span class="movietitle">Indiana Jones</span> was first suggested to Spielberg by George Lucas in 1977. Spielberg would direct and Lucas would produce. They negotiated a favorable deal with Paramount, but it was highly dependent on Spielberg being able to deliver the movie on time and budget.</p>
      <p>He accomplished this with a renewed production regiment, involving an expanded storyboarding practice, newly capable and reliable producers, in Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, and a willingness to shoot to get the job done.</p>
      <p>Spielberg and Lucas jointly worked out the story in a <a href="https://maddogmovies.com/almost/scripts/raidersstoryconference1978.pdf">series of meetings</a> with writer Lawrence Kasden, in which they wrestled over whether the character should be more Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart.</p>
      <p>Both Spielberg and Lucas saw themselves—and each other—in Indiana Jones. Lucas said that “If l could be a dream figure, I'd be Indy,” and Spielberg later <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1py7Yltxvq0wThBrAVWAh7UuNp_5wZ1AF/view?usp=sharing">poked fun</a> at Lucas being “a kind of dweeby Indiana Jones.”</p>
      <p>And Spielberg also saw himself in the role: “I was the Indiana Jones behind the camera. I felt I didn't have to shoot for a masterpiece. Every shot didn't have to be something David Lean would be proud of.”</p>

      <p>(Clip) “‘You said once that you are all of your characters. What part of Steven Spielberg for instance was in a guy like Indiana Jones? What childhood fantasies of yours were you living out through him?’ ‘Every television show I ever watched from the ages of 2 through I think 12, and every serial I ever saw. Indiana Jones represents the hero that I’ve always wanted to be, and the hero that none of us will ever be within our lifetimes.’”</p>
      <p>Spielberg had come up with the concept for <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> while working on <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>. </p>

      <figure>

      <p>(Clip, 1996) “<span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>...  we were shooting that sometime around 1979 or ’80. I remember spending—not a lot of time between shots because I shot <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span> so quickly, there wasn’t a lot of time to think between shots—but there was a particularly long setup and I walked out into the desert. I was picking up prehistoric seashells out there, because certainly the desert part used to be the ocean a long long time ago. Maybe that’s where <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> came from, at least my interest in dinosaurs, I don’t know! But that all was a cousin to turning over seashells and trying to figure out, ‘How can I tell the story of this lonely boy?’ I’m sitting here. I’m a lonely director out in Tunisia, making a Saturday Matinee serial type of movie. I won’t go into my personal life, but I was feeling a bit separate from myself, which often happens when you’re directing. You often go into a fugue state to make a movie. And I was in one of my fugue states, And suddenly, bang, this concept hit me, I knew exactly how to tell the story of <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, and the story flooded into my mind, and during the next few days during the shooting of <span class="movietitle">Raiders</span>, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> pretty much had a beginning, a middle, and an end.”</p>

         <img src="../img/dossier126.png">

      <p>(Clip, 2002) “I really have always thought that <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span> was about the divorce of my mom and dad. And ever since my parents divorced... —I think I was about 16, 17-years old. I had a lot of stories in my mind about how to tell it. And I had this story kicking around about a boy who finds an imaginary friend, in this case it would be an extraterrestrial friend. And that was going to fill his many many needs for the missing father. And it was during shots, on breaks on <span class="movietitle">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>, in the desert the whole story began to fill itself in for me. [... ] I was desperate for a writer. And I wanted that to be written yesterday. I wanted to pour out all this to somebody and have the person write it all down. True to form it was Indiana Jones who came to the rescue. Harrison Ford’s girlfriend and future wife, screenwriter Melissa Matheson, just happened to be on the set.”</p>

      <p>He <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5l6kkkc2Ex3mFthEyU8iMvI4wGgtqvV/view?usp=sharing">loved</a> her draft (“E.T. and Me”), and they rushed it to production. He had been planning to do <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> next, based on a script called <span class="booktitle">Night Skies</span>, a sort-of sequel to <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span> based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly–Hopkinsville_encounter">account</a> that came up in his research about a farmhouse family terrorized by malevolent aliens. He’d hired John Sayles (<span class="movietitle">Piranha</span> (1978), dir. Joe Dante) to turn it into a screenplay, but eventually wrote it himself, incorporating several of his childhood memories. </p>
      <p>At the same time, he’d been wanting to do a movie about children. Spielberg reported that Truffaut had told him: “You must make a movie about keeds. You must stop all this big stuff and make a movie about keeds! If it's the last thing you do!” Spielberg had tasked Gale and Zemeckis with writing the project, but didn’t give them much guidance except that it should be about kids. The three of them worked briefly on a script called <span class="booktitle">After School</span>.</p>
      <p>In <span class="booktitle">Night Skies</span>, one of the aliens, a benevolent one named Buddy, befriends an autistic boy. This side-plot provided the axis for Spielberg’s movie about kids, <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>, while <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span> remained the “hostile” successor to <span class="movietitle">Close Encounters</span>.</p>

      <p>(clip June 1982 [??]) “I made these two movies very closely. I will never make two movies this close together again. I, on the other hand, didn't have rack of lamb between both pictures, I essentially had Motza and butter, and that was about it and went right into the next movie. But, um, both movies were very good for me to make. So in such close proximity to each other, because both being rooted in suburbia in a kind of middle-class suburbia, both essentially employing similar kinds of tract housing. And yet one screen movie being about a scream and the other movie being about a kind of soft whisper.  It was very good for me because I was able to trade off objectivity, which I think is very important for a movie director or a writer is anybody who has to stand away from his work and look back and say, I know how to make that better. It's good to have diversions. And I was very lucky because I was able to have a hostile diversion with <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, with spiritual warmth in places. And I was able to have that. Warm tender diversion with <span class="movietitle">E.T.</span>. And I kept putting one into the other, not meaning I didn't share it too with <span class="movietitle">Poltergeist</span>, but I, I, it cleared my mind when you eat sushi. I dunno. You know, when you would sushi the Japanese say, you must take the ginger and eat a little bit of the ginger between sushi courses, because it clears the palate and it makes you more receptive to the taste of the food.”</p>
      <p>Although Spielberg plays Freudian analysis off as a joke, <span class="movietitle">The Fabelmans</span>, for example, pivots around Sammy Fabelman’s emotional affair with his mother, and sustains an understated symbolic castration motif.[^14]</p>

      <p>Speaking on <span class="movietitle">Catch Me If You Can</span>, Spielberg said “It takes, sometimes, something very Freudian to get me to say, 'Well, this is interesting; I better read beyond page fifty.’”</p>
      <p>But so far Spielberg’s therapeutic testimony has gone largely unheard and unexamined.</p>

      <p>[P32 – “to our humiliation and enhancement, that the whole comedy of art is not at all performed for us, for our improvement or edification, any more than we are the actual creators of that art world: but we can indeed assume for our own part that we are images and artistic projections for the true creator of the world, and that our highest dignity lies in the meaning of works of art – for it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified – while of course our awareness of our meaning differs hardly at all from the awareness that warriors painted on canvas have of the battle portrayed.</p>
      <p>Thus all of our knowledge of art is utterly illusory, because we, as knowing subjects, are not identical with that being which, as sole creator and spectator of that comedy of art, prepares an eternal enjoyment for itself.</p>
      <p>Only in so far as the genius is fused with the primal artists of the world in the act of artistic creation does he know anything of the eternal essence of art; for in that state he is wonderfully similar to the weird fairy-tale image of the creature that can turn its eyes around and look at itself; now he is at once subject and object, at once poet, actor, and audience.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>The metaphor itself is a reference to the Greek figure of Cedalion, a dwarf who helps a giant regain his sight. There are two versions: one with the cyclops Polyphemus, after he’s blinded by Odysseus; and one with giant Orion, after he’s blinded by King Oenepion, a son of Dionysius, for drunkenly raping his daughter Merope. In both cases, Cedalion steers the wounded giant to the East, so that he may be healed by the sun, Helios. In the first case, Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and fire, must direct Helios to focus his rays upon Polyphemus in a particular way so that he is not pained by their intense heat. In the second, Hephaestus is the one who commands Cedalion to guide Orion to Helios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The traditional myth of Cedalion provides an alternate model to that of the titan Prometheus for understanding man’s relationship to technology. Prometheus steals fire (conceived as the ur-technology) and is punished by Zeus, whereas the healing of Polyphemus and Orion is facilitated by Hephaestus’ knowledge of Helios. But Malcolm’s inheritance of the myth in the vein of Nietszche makes it equivalent to that of Prometheus.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>It’s possible that Malcolm is committed to the idea that dinosaurs failed natural selection insofar as they died of disease, in which case one could say that they were “selected by nature for extinction”. In which case Malcolm would be no different from Grant’s academic rivals. Malcolm’s position would then proxy that with his rivals: whether it’s wise or not to resuscitate species that failed natural selection in the non-random sense. Or in other words about whether a species that’s failed natural selection might be worth another chance, with Malcolm and Grant’s rivals saying they’re not.</li>
         <li>When dinosaur bones were first discovered in 1819 some believed them to be the bones of these giants, validating the biblical account of history. Instead, in the years to come they would strongly support Darwin’s theory of evolution and the naturalization of the biblical account.</li>
         <li>Freud: “This becomes especially clear where Fate is looked upon in the strictly religious sense of being nothing else than an expression of the Divine Will. The people of Israel had believed themselves to be the favourite child of God, and when the great Father caused misfortune after misfortune to rain down upon this people of his, they were never shaken in their belief in his relationship to them or questioned his power or righteousness. Instead, they produced the prophets, who held up their sinfulness before them; and out of their sense of guilt they created the overstrict commandments of their priestly religion.”</li>
         <li>If we apply the analogy of genetic technology to film technology, Hammond is referring to the elements of filmmaking. The trapeze, or trapezoid—the shape of the cinema screen as seen from any position in the theatre, prior to perceptual processes that make it always look like a rectangle. The carousel—this is the rotating base of the Victorian instrument used to make drawings seem to come to life, symbolizing the persistence of vision effect. And the seesaw—this is the famous mechanical crane introduced by Aeschylus into the ancient theatre of Dionysius to suggest the entry of the gods themselves into the dramatic action, signifying human beings’ ability to interrupt natural causality.</li>
         <li><span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> has a strong food and food chain motif. Carnivores versus herbivores, turkey, Chilean Sea Bass, cows and goats, and so on. The portrait of Hammond sadly eating his ice cream is reminiscent of Thyestes, the head of the house of Atreus. Thyestes steals the golden fleece from his brother by trickery, and as a result, by his brother’s vengeance, is unknowingly fed his own children. While there is critical debate concerning whether Thyestes (whom Aristotle identifies in his Poetics as a paradigmatic tragic hero, along with Oedipus) deserved his punishment (see Belfiore 167-168, and Sherman, 186), along one dimension of causality it seems that he receives his just desserts for neglecting his children. And this is how Malcolm and Hammond turn out to see themselves deep down.</li>
         <li>He is therefore challenging the Promethean paradigm as the singular mode of interpreting technology, and the Nietszchean reading of the myths of Polyphemus/Orion with regards to Cedalion, Helios, and Hephaestus. Another way of looking at this is that Grant has shifted the object of his search from the first technology, to the first technology that becomes necessarily corruptive. He is no longer satisfied with “fire,” but must consider other candidates, such as optics, analogy, writing, money, and time-counting.</li>

      <p>“Those are called hypomnematic in which only the main points/headings [τἁ κεϕαλαια] are written out [άπογράϕονται]: for you should know that formerly, if someone decided to write something up [συγγράψασθαι], they wrote out in the form of main points/headings [κεϕαλαιωδῶς] the things they had individually discovered which would contribute to proving their thesis, and they also took many thoughts from the books of older writers, in order to confirm what was right and to refute what was wrong; but afterwards, having imposed some order on these [main points/headings], they wove their treatises [συγγράμματα] by polishing them with beauty in the formulations [λόγοι] and with care in the narration [ἀπαγγελία].32</p>
      <p>And thus the hypomnematic are distinguished from the syntagmatic writings by order and by beauty of expression” (Ammonius In Categorias 4,5-13)</p>

      <p>Spielberg first saw the galleys for Peter Benchley’s novel, <span class="booktitle">Jaws</span>, on his Universal Studios producer Dick Zanuck’s desk in 1973. He begged to make it, and it was only after Universal won the rights that Spielberg realized how difficult it would be to shoot. Because of its technical challenges, <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> went several times over its originally planned shooting schedule and budget at Martha’s Vineyard. Although Benchley wrote the first draft, it was quickly discarded. A second draft by Howard Sackler was more successful at reducing the story to its elements. The final pages were written by Carl Gottlieb with Spielberg every night after dinner at Spielberg’s cabin, with the extended schedule affording them time to workshop scenes with the leads (McBride 238-9).</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Spielberg once told <a href="https://youtu.be/3SUmUnLMWYQ?si=V0QxZyJDzxCKMrRL&t=482">Pauline Kael</a> that she was the only film critic to understand <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>. <a href="https://emdashes.com/2006/08/a-goldmine-of-pauline-kael-rev.php">Picking up on</a> the bits he had riffed with his actors, she interpreted the movie as a lampoon of toxic masculinity; like an early Woody Allen film, but with more zest and electricity. She saw Spielberg’s verve as a filmmaker reflected in Dreyfuss’ playful post-doc, and, to a lesser extent, in the sensitive Chief Brody, as opposed to Shaw’s old-school alpha male, “so manly he wants to get them all killed; so manly he’s homicidal.” She was still able to read <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> as a sort of New Hollywood art film because of its unusual rhythms. It was campy and sweet at the same time as it was violent and jarring.</p>
      <p>As much as Pauline Kael liked <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, there was something about it that nagged at her. It was what she called “the hidden confusion of historical fact and sadistic fantasy.” It concerns Quint’s famous USS Indianapolis monologue.</p>
      <p>“He tells the ultimate shark horror story—it's worse, even, than anything that we see in the movie. The story he tells concerns the men of the Indianapolis, a heavy cruiser that was torpedoed after delivering key elements of the atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan. As Shaw, in drunken, sepulchral tones, describes the events, the survivors were attacked by sharks, which returned day after day, using the ever-smaller group of survivors as a feeding ground. Actually, it is not known how many of the Indianapolis crew died because of sharks, or how many died from exposure, or from injuries sustained when the ship was hit. The mono­logue, conceived by Howard Sackler, embellished to a length of nine pages by John Milius, and then trimmed by Spielberg and Shaw to a feasible length, could easily have dealt with a fictitious ship, but using the correct name gave it an extra plausibility. In the rest of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span>, we're worked over right in the open, but in this Indianapolis episode we're fooled by a hidden confusion of historical fact and sadistic fantasy. The writers probably didn't consider—or were simply indifferent to the nightmarish pain that their gothic embroidery would give to the relatives of the men who died in those waters.”</p>
      <p>Kael found it distasteful that the audience would be led to perceive a true story as though it were fiction, specifically because the secret fictionalization of the truth was sadistic: that is, causing pain needlessly. The analysis could be extended further, as the stunts of <span class="movietitle">Jaws</span> were known to be sloppy. Susan Backlinie, who played the first shark victim, was pulled back and forth by 10 men on each side with ropes, and, according to Julia Phillips, suffered lacerations and bruises for years to come (“don’t ask”). When Jeffrey Voorhees, the child who played the Kintner boy killed before Brody’s eyes, was supposed to go down in an explosion of blood, he couldn’t get the timing right, so a diver was sent to hold him under water.</p>
      <p>And—most to Kael’s point—when the production needed footage of Dreyfuss encountering the gigantic Jaws underwater, they decided to hire a person of short stature to get the scale right against real Great Whites filmed in Australian waters. This person was lowered into chummed waters with a defective oxygen tank, and nearly eaten alive when a shark got caught . The footage was too good not to use.</p>
      <p>Just a year before the accident, during a long-form <a href="https://youtu.be/ZCmPtl39BWQ?t=2168">interview</a> on the Dick Cavett Show in 1981, Spielberg demonstrated a strong acquaintance with the possibility for stunt accidents in the industry:</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
         <p>CAVETT</p>
         <p>Do you know situations—obviously without naming names and so on—where the stuntmen have been unnecessarily endangered, and in fact, maimed and killed? I know one lost both legs. Is it Yvonne de Carlos’ husband... —</p>
         <p>SPIELBERG</p>
         <p>Do you mean the helicopter accident?</p>
         <p>CAVETT</p>
         <p>This is two trains.</p>
         <p>SPIELBERG</p>
         <p>There’s a famous helicopter accident where... it wasn't a stuntman. He was a cameraman with a special Tyler mount out to the back of a jet ranger, the side of a jet ranger. He went too close to another helicopter below him and he lost his legs. ... </p>
         <p>I mean, it’s not just stuntmen. The tragedy last week where we lost Boris Sagal. Very, very excellent and wonderful director and human being who walked into the back rotor blade of a propeller. ... </p>
         <p>There's something that happens when you're making a film, especially with directors and cameraman. And that is when your eye is to the camera, you are taken away to a Never-Never land, a kind of reality Oz. And suddenly, with the eye glued to the camera, nothing can happen to you. You could be on the edge of a train, looking through a viewfinder, heading towards a tunnel with no clearance. And as far as you're concerned, it's only a movie until everything goes black, and then white. And I think, I think it's, it's, it's almost the sirens that are calling you.</p>

      <p>[^4]:  Steve Williams resists the emphasis on Tippett’s “extinction”-resurrection arc. Williams had been Animation Supervisor on <span class="movietitle">The Abyss</span> and <span class="movietitle">Terminator 2,</span> and now, despite single-handedly redeeming the prospect of seamless CGI for <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>, that role was given to Tippett. “Kathleen Kennedy pats me on the back and goes, ‘You have a very bright future.’ And that was that. That was the first and only time I ever met her. I never saw her again.” He was astonished by the lack of recognition that followed his breakthrough, failing to be thanked even in <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span>’s Best Visual Effects Oscar speech.</p>
      <p>[^5]:  This dynamic also exists in optimistic or wish-fulfilled versions, such as the beatific vision of the brachiosaurs, or the elevation to safety in the trees, or the final escape by helicopter.</p>
      <p>[^6]:  Steven <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Breaking_and_Entering.html?id=JZc6zwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y">Starkey</a> had been an editor at ILM assigned to edit a promotional documentary for <span class="movietitle">Frank Marshall: The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>. He would go on to edit <span class="movietitle">The Making of Poltergeist</span> and <span class="movietitle">The Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</span>, before moving into the Amblin bungalow on the Universal lot and was encouraged to pivot to Associate Producer by Frank Marshall, who was solidified as his “mentor.” Starkey was hired on to <span class="movietitle">Jurassic Park</span> in September 1990, when he was put in charge of preparing a budget and a production plan in coordination with Carter. They had previously worked together on <span class="movietitle">Amazing Stories</span> and <span class="movietitle">Back to the Future Part II</span> and <span class="movietitle">III</span>. Their first budget was too expensive for Spielberg, so they began to make script revisions. Eventually, Steve Starkey turned these into a 3-page document that allowed Spielberg to greenlight the budget. But once Hook started, Starkey was put onto other projects (he’d initially felt “jilted” when his contribution had been minimized, but was quickly offered the role of Producer on <span class="movietitle">Death Becomes Her</span>). Carter and Starkey’s work would eventually become <a href="https://www.trescom.org/hosted/scallenger/jurassictime/jtfiles/research/scripts/JURASSIC%20PARK%2003-07-1991%20\(Carter%20&%20Crichton\">Carter’s draft</a>%20%5bTranscription%5d.pdf), following a separate evolution from Crichton’s first draft; but then incorporating the changes Spielberg liked from Crichton’s second along with ideas brainstormed a few days later. Carter knew Crichton personally and had been in touch with him to keep apprised of story developments. He’d also submitted several <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3024487960943222&type=3">story memos</a> of his own. Although Tom Stoppard (<span class="movietitle">Empire of the Sun</span>, 1989) was being considered, Carter knew Marmo was also in the conversation but was <a href="https://youtu.be/3TOJwJKPg4o?si=bGVGrfds_zL2BzEs&t=270">concerned</a> that she was going to (or did, eventually) take the story down “the wrong path.” The existence of Carter’s draft was only uncovered in 2020 by Derrick Davis. He turned it into an <a href="https://jurassictime.wixsite.com/memoirs/rcjp-illustrated-audio-drama">illustrated audio drama</a>, imagining Carter’s version brought to life, in which he combined the script and story memos with his collection of rare and unreleased concept art and storyboards, including an entire binder that had belonged to Tippett.</p>
      <p>[^7]:  Marmo’s analogy is ambivalent—it’s difficult to entirely distinguish whether it refers to a T-Rex, a velociraptor, or some hybrid with a mosquito or a dragonfly. As a symbol, then, it reflects Freud’s principle of condensation.</p>
      <p>[^8]:  Critic Henry Sheehan finds this moment to be echoed again in the main road T-Rex attack, in which Grant interrupts his own “(barely) suppressed murder fantasy” by snapping out of a trancelike moment of indecision. See Ch. 8.</p>
